        "transcript": "Okay . Or you get it . Okay . No I don't think so it has to be like that yeah and you have to adjust the length . Okay , and then . {vocalsound} So we uh {disfmarker} we will wait for Anna , a few minutes . Yeah , s yeah , um . {vocalsound} Mm {vocalsound} . Yours is well {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I think you can put anywhere you want , actually . I thin Yeah but the the mic should not {disfmarker} It's not a directional mic , anyway . I think it should work like this . {vocalsound} Uh . So I will try to get my presentation running . Yeah . Yeah . Mm . Mm . Can't help you with that . Last . It's no matter . Okay , it's y yeah . No problem . Ah yes . Right . Okay . Then press uh al Okay . This . I don't know . You know ? Just try . 'Kay . On this normal {disfmarker} Oh oh . Alt F_ five . Good . Doesn't appear on the screen here . {vocalsound} Right well {disfmarker} Oh . Wow . Amazing . It's working {vocalsound} . Okay . Thank you . {vocalsound} Uh . Hold that . Okay . Yes and you can put can clip it uh on your {disfmarker} Okay . Mm . Somewhere . So , {vocalsound} good morning , everyone . Um {disfmarker} Welcome at uh {disfmarker} at the kick off meeting of our uh latest project . {vocalsound} I hope you all have been uh updated about it . Yeah . Good . So . Yes . So w we will try to structure this uh meeting with an a with an agenda uh as presented here . Um after the opening we will tr get acquainted to each other . {vocalsound} See what our roles are in this project . So , um {disfmarker} We have been provided with uh some uh w technical tools to uh {disfmarker} to communicate and to well , learn from each other's plans uh as I can say um so w we will also try to uh to get acquainted to this tools so they are also new to me I don't know whether you worked with them before . Um then we will come to the uh to the to the actual project plan . You all know I hope {vocalsound} how it's about uh the uh new r remote control we are going going to design . Mm-hmm . Total . Uh then we will uh discuss uh , well , how it should be and uh {disfmarker} wh what uh what our new product should look lite {disfmarker} like . And uh well then uh after some twenty five minutes I hope uh we can end this meeting . So . Um basically this is about a uh a new c remote control . Um {disfmarker} We {disfmarker} When you design a new product you of {disfmarker} uh you of course want it to be original . Be uh {disfmarker} we want to be distinguished , mm ? People uh want to uh when they look at the shelf want to think , well that's the product I I need . So it needs to be trendy . I mean trendy is what people want , so then I w they will buy our product . But then , uh , it also should work uh user friendly and uh otherwise people uh uh well it will not be uh be rated very well in consumer uh articles and like that . {vocalsound} So , the general outline of uh new project will be we first uh go through a functional design phase . Um {disfmarker} You all get uh um certain task uh in this uh in this phase and uh then we will meet again and uh discuss this functional design . And the same holds for the uh ph two phases uh after this , the conceptual design and after that a a more detailed design in which the the final project should get its definite shape . Alright , but first we will do some uh tool training . In all in front of you uh you see uh the uh notebooks and w uh n note blocks and we have here a a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a white-board . Whitebo Mm-hmm . And um well it should work uh {disfmarker} I've read it from my uh from some colleague that it should work with some kind of toolbar . I didn't find out yet how it work , but maybe one of you did , so {disfmarker} Um {disfmarker} Under documents in the shared folder . Okay . Yes . Do {disfmarker} Do we have to say something about that ? I I I'm not fully updated about this shared folder uh . Yeah , I guess we'll have a shared folder uh with documents that we can share . And uh , yeah . Yes well we will then find out ho how it works . Yes . Um . Well , this seems to me , yes , some computer program but I didn't find it yet . So , we'll come to that later . So , uh now we will try out the white-board we have here . So , I would suggest uh {disfmarker} Each of us is going . Well , yes , um we uh we should try to t to draw on it and then well it should be smart some way . I {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I'm not really sure how this works , but {disfmarker} Okay , shall I start ? Mm . Yeah . Yes , Yeah , a good idea Mael . you can start it you know . I think for us it's just like a normal whiteboard , but they'll be recording what we write down . So , i No they will record through that . There's a sensor over there Mm . Mm . which is going to record the strokes that you make . But for us it's just like a normal whiteboard . Okay . Yeah . 'Kay . {vocalsound} But it's {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Actually , I think I cannot go with uh {disfmarker} You {disfmarker} you {disfmarker} D doesn't it work ? Maybe someo Maybe {disfmarker} maybe Anna , maybe you can start . Mm-hmm . Yeah . Then he can maybe find out to get his cord right . I have to draw . So um {disfmarker} L Why don't you draw uh {vocalsound} your favourite animal on on th on the white-board . {vocalsound} M my {disfmarker} my favourite animal . {vocalsound} Sorry this is all tangled up here . Oh , I see uh {disfmarker} That's better . Yeah . {vocalsound} Yeah . Yes . Mm . So draw it . We will try to guess what it is . {vocalsound} Mm-hmm . {vocalsound} I'm a very bad drawer . {vocalsound} Weird . Um . You're not gonna be able to guess from my drawing . I'm a bad drawer . Okay . Mm . They're ears , by the way . 's a cat . No . Um close though . Okay so {disfmarker} like a pet animal . {vocalsound} Okay . {vocalsound} Like a cat . Yeah . It's like a cat , so I guess it's a cat . {vocalsound} No , not a cat though . What is this now ? Ah you forget about it . You're on the knife . Yeah , uh I think it's fine . I just don't want to carry it off . Man , this wires , eh ? We need a wireless microphone . {vocalsound} You know ? Pro specially we should next project we should take l like that . Okay . So . So , It's not a cat , that's the cat . it's a dog . Oh . So . Mael . It's a dog . Yes . So but that's also kind of cat , Oh isn't it ? the dog doesn't have a tail ? {vocalsound} It's got a tail then . B bo both predators . Yeah , sure , yeah . Yeah yeah . I thought so . The dogs have a tail . So do cats . So , thank you . Uh d did you uh work out cord ? {vocalsound} {vocalsound} And you guessed cats without a tail . {vocalsound} Yeah . Yeah , I think I will go without {disfmarker} without it , Okay . Okay . right ? It'll still not extend , right ? It's not up to that . Okay , there you go . So what favourite characteristics . Uh . Dogs are always friendly and loyal and fun . A horse ? It's a horse . {vocalsound} This is why you're the designer . And I'm marketing . {vocalsound} Yes . Yes , yes this is {disfmarker} Yes definitely a horse . Yes . Oh very good . So {disfmarker} Ah {vocalsound} I suppose it {disfmarker} Ah I think you can put that . Mm-hmm . That's it . {vocalsound} A blue and black zebra {vocalsound} . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yes . Can {disfmarker} you can meet them in Africa , I think . Yes . Very good . So {disfmarker} The very rare blue zebras . Yes . {gap} I'll tell to get it off my {disfmarker} Ma Matthew ? Uh ? Mm-hmm . So {disfmarker} You got a lot of room here . Maybe {disfmarker} You can probably reach . Oh y it's not for that . No ? No . I hope you have some space in your uh the horse of uh Mael . Okay . Yeah . So what should I draw ? Mm . He has already to do cat . I took a dog . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Um . A mouse ? This looks likes a cat who has been driven over . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Okay . {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} And we should sum up its favourite charas characteristics , right ? Mm-hmm . {vocalsound} Yes , the moustache . So {disfmarker} That's {disfmarker} that's definitely a cat . Mm-hmm . Uh yeah . And i Th They like to sleep , that's why you said you they are like this . {vocalsound} It's quite , you know {disfmarker} relaxed situation . {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} Yes . Mm-hmm . {vocalsound} Yes , okay . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} She has the small legs . Th thank you , Matthew . Yeah . {vocalsound} Thank you , Matthew . {vocalsound} It's a very big rat . Or a very small cat . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Perfect . {vocalsound} Oh a rat , okay . Yes , this is certain uh {disfmarker} some contribution to our project . {vocalsound} Mm 'kay . And you , {gap} Your turn . So . Let's see . Which animal has not been drawn yet . So you've all drawn land animals , {vocalsound} so why not draw an animal from the water . A bird . Okay , in the water . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Ah I don't know what that is . It's a bit {disfmarker} Mm . {vocalsound} Mm . {vocalsound} It's a bit hard to guess . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} So {disfmarker} Put it colours . Maybe it would help us . Yeah . Yes . The cat is going to eat the fish or the rat ? With different pen widths . {vocalsound} Mm-hmm.$ {vocalsound} So {disfmarker} Oh , it's a shark now . Ah it's a shark , yeah . {vocalsound} Oh , yes , why not ? {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Good idea . Ah it's a baby shark , it looks to me , Mm . you know it's going to eat the cat rather than the cat eating the fish , no ? Oh . Now it's a swordfish . {vocalsound} Why not . A swordfish . {vocalsound} You have some in {disfmarker} in Australia , right ? Swordfish . {vocalsound} Yeah . Um , maybe . I dunno . I've never seen one , no . Oh well . Yeah . I hope it still works . So {disfmarker} Perfect . So I dunno if we need to spend time on that , actually {vocalsound} But uh {disfmarker} You should go for the next one it seems to me . W Well , this uh this tool seemed to work . Mm-hmm . Yeah , exactly , yeah . {vocalsound} Let's continue to uh {disfmarker} to the real stuff . Wow . Um our project uh finance uh thing . Uh when we are {disfmarker} and when w you are uh going to design w uh we must keep in mind that the selling price of the product uh will be about twenty five Euros , so when designing a project uh I also look at you uh Mael , keep in mind uh uh uh {disfmarker} People uh Twenty four . Yeah . want to get the feeling this is a twenty five Euro project uh pr um product . Per remote control , Mm . yeah ? Per project . Yes . Okay . Um {vocalsound} more interesting for our company {vocalsound} of course , p uh profit aim , about fifty million Euro . So we have to sell uh quite a lot of this uh {vocalsound} um things . Uh we will try to uh to get at a international market uh so um it will be I think mainly Europe and uh Northern America , Ah yeah , the sale man , four million . maybe some uh Asian countries . Um also important for you all is um the the product uh production cost must be maximal uh twelve uh twelve Euro and fifty cents . {vocalsound} So it's half of the selling price , if I am good in mathematics . Yes , of course . Uh um I mean we still have to uh to make a profit , huh ? They have to sell at least four million to make a profit {vocalsound} Of course . Mm . {vocalsound} You all have to be paid . Mm . Excuse me ? Ah we have to make {disfmarker} we have to sell at least four million to make our own profit . Fifty mill Oh you're g very good in mathematics . Yes . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yes , indeed . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Four million . So uh well I think w when we are working on the international market , uh in principle it has enough customers Yeah . uh so when we have a good product we uh we could uh meet this this aim , I think . So , that about finance . And uh now just let have some discussion about what is a good remote control and uh well keep in mind this this first point , it has to be original , it has to be trendy , it has to be user friendly . Um , maybe someone can mention some additional uh prerequisites for a good remote control . Mm-hmm . Of course it should have a on off button . {vocalsound} Mm-hmm . Yes , well i it should have the the the the expected functionality uh of a remote control . Mm . Yeah . Yeah , s and it depends what application you are using it for . Mm . You might need uh {disfmarker} We wer we were thinking television . Uh . Mm . We are targ targeting the television set . So , Mm . you need to record the channels . Yeah . Mm-hmm . {vocalsound} You need to browse the {disfmarker} browse the channels in upward downward way , Mm . Yes , yes . Th th that's very handy I {disfmarker} I always miss it and {disfmarker} on some remote controls that you can go channel up or down ins instead of retyping the number , especially when you have a lot of channels . Uh {disfmarker} And {disfmarker} Mm . Mm . Uh , and {disfmarker} And uh just before starting the detailed discussion , maybe we are the marketing guy ? Or {disfmarker} I'm marketing . Marketing . th So you are the marketing . Yep . And you are in the u use user interface uh design . Yeah . Yes . Yeah . So just {disfmarker} yeah I wanted to to be sure . Sure . And I I'm the the industrial designer Mm-hmm . Yes . {vocalsound} okay . Oh . Because I I don't know you very well , actually , but yeah . I'm Matthew . You know . {vocalsound} Okay . Mael . Matth s uh Happy to meet you . Anna . Anna . {vocalsound} Okay . It's very uh {disfmarker} A and I'm Nanne . And um uh Matthew , yeah . So {disfmarker} I thi think you know me , Uh so yeah uh {disfmarker} Just uh on your web page but uh yeah not uh {disfmarker} not face to face . Yes . yeah ? right yeah . So . Um {disfmarker} S So . {vocalsound} So mm {disfmarker} S s Mm . Are there some other very important things to to do {disfmarker} well , So {disfmarker} {vocalsound} So I to specify in this first phase of of the project . So the browse function , as you m mentioned . Mm . Yeah . Oth yeah . And uh , you'd need the usual ones , like the changing the volume , changing the the channel and then {disfmarker} you uh {disfmarker} Yes . Yeah . Today we have uh um teletext and all those things . Tomorrow you might have a some more functions which might come through that , so {disfmarker} Yes . Like what ? Like internet on the on T_V_ ? Mm . Yeah I_P_O_ or . Now we are looking for television things or I_P_ . For example personal video recorder and all those stuffs are coming up . Yeah . Mm . But we can't really design for something that hasn't been invented yet . Yeah . Ah it's {disfmarker} it's {disfmarker} it's {disfmarker} it's coming up , actually . The personal video recorder and all those things it is coming up . Mm , well uh I I think {disfmarker} Uh w y you two should {disfmarker} should , I think , think this over uh w espec what , what functionality . {vocalsound} Actually , yeah Let's {disfmarker} Let's take {disfmarker} w {vocalsound} Of course , and first before um designing the func well thinking about the functionalities , we need to know what are the user requirements . Mm . Yeah . Um then if they need internet , then we would be able to to p to propose something with uh uh T_V_ over I_P_ . Mm-hmm . Yeah . Mm . Yeah . But {disfmarker} Ninety percent of the time , ninety nine percent of the time , people will be using the main functions , the volume , the different channels , so we can have all the fancy things as well but the main controls need to be very obvious and very easy to use . Mm mm mm . Keep k keep in mind i it's a {disfmarker} it's a twenty five Euro unit , so uh uh the the very fancy stuff uh w we can leave that out , I think . Mm . So twenty five Euro you expect a quite , well normal but good functioning user friendly remote control . Mm . Oh in that case you can you always hook up with uh someone who is providing that and you know , {vocalsound} you {disfmarker} you sell their product as well as your product with them , you know . {vocalsound} Mm . So try and get T_V_ manufacturers to {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Yeah . Yeah , but w w we want to design a new one . {vocalsound} Mm . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} No , it's okay , yeah I understand . So we need some numbering buttons , some teletext things Yeah . and then um {disfmarker} The {disfmarker} Yeah , the main is browsing . Yeah . Yes , but but but ab about the spec the buttons , the buttons uh that will be on it . I I think we can discuss that in the in the next meeting . Yeah . Yeah . Uh I would like to get this wrapped up and go to an end of this meeting . Okay . So {disfmarker} Okay , we are alread mm . Mm . So Okay . you know now the basic {disfmarker} the basic things . Mm-hmm . Yeah . well just {disfmarker} just for the next meeting , um L well , uh , you wor yes , work on a design , keep it general , I mean {disfmarker} so w we will be still fle flexible with maybe adding some functions . So {disfmarker} Mm-hmm . Um you will be working on {disfmarker} on technical function design , so {disfmarker} Yeah , sure . And uh you {disfmarker} and you and uh uh uh well , think about requirements , Mm-hmm . eh ? Does it need internet , or or do do we stay at basic basic television uh interface . Stam . Yeah . So , uh I think we should now all go work uh uh at this Mm-hmm . and uh you will be informed via email and other kind of communication . Yeah . Okay . So next meeting will be in uh {disfmarker} in thirty minutes uh . Perfect . K keep it in mind .",
        "summarize": "Project Manager introduced a new remote control project for television sets, and the team got acquainted with each other and technical devices. The remote control would be priced at 25 Euros and a production cost of 12.5 Euros. Priority will be given to standard features, such as sorting through channels, instead of more advanced internet features."

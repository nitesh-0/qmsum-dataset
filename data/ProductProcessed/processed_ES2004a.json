        "transcript": "Hmm hmm hmm . {vocalsound} Are we {disfmarker} we're not allowed to dim the lights so people can see that a bit better ? Yeah . Okay , that's fine . Am I supposed to be standing up there ? Okay . So we've got both of these clipped on ? She gonna answer me or not ? Yeah , I've got {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Right , both of them , okay . Yes . God . {vocalsound} Jesus , it's gonna fall off {gap} . Okay . Yep , yep . {vocalsound} Okay . Tu tu tu tu Okay . {vocalsound} Hello everybody . Hi , good morning . Um I'm Sarah , the Project Manager and this is our first meeting , surprisingly enough . Okay , this is our agenda , um {vocalsound} we will do some stuff , get to know each other a bit better to feel more comfortable with each other . Um then we'll go do tool training , talk about the project plan , discuss our own ideas and everything um and we've got twenty five minutes to do that , as far as I can understand . Now , we're developing a remote control which you probably already know . Um , we want it to be original , something that's uh {disfmarker} people haven't thought of , that's not out in the shops , um , trendy , appealing to a wide market , but you know , not a hunk of metal , and user-friendly , grannies to kids , maybe even pooches should be able to use it . Okay , um , first is the functional design , um this is where we all go off and do our individual work , um what needs need to be fulfilled by the product , um what effects the product has to have and how it's actually going to do that . Um , conceptual design , what we're thinking , how it's gonna go and then the detailed design , how we're actually gonna put it into practice and make it work . 'Kay . Okay , right . We're gonna practice with the pens and draw our favourite animal on the white board , I'll go first , and um sum up the characteristics of that animal . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} So {disfmarker} Oops . Okay , I'll leave space for everyone else . Um {disfmarker} What's missing ? We're running out of blue . Okay . I'm not gonna ask you to guess , I'm going to tell you that's supposed to be a tiger . Mm . And I see them as majestic , and independent , and proud . Oh sorry . Mm-hmm . Now , who would like to go next ? Yeah , me . 'Kay . {vocalsound} {gap} Cat . Where did this come from ? Is that your lapel then ? Uh , yep . There you go . Thank you . Uh , maybe you can guess what I'm trying to make ? A kind of dog ? {vocalsound} Yep . It's actually sitting , so {vocalsound} {vocalsound} It's sitting down . Sorry ? it's sitting , it's not standing . Uh . Okay , I see it as one thing it's very supportive . It's your best friend and your {disfmarker} you can talk to a dog , it can be your best friend , it doesn't discriminate between you , based on what you are . Second it's loyal and third thing it's got intuition . {gap} dogs can som sometimes can make out between a thief and a person Mm-hmm . so basically these are the three unique features I think belong to a dog . Okay , thank you . Thank you . Yeah I'll have a go . Okay . Sorry . Thanks . Please , please leave me a space at the bottom , I'm little , {vocalsound} Alright , okay . you can get to the top , with standing on a chair . Well since you guys have chosen the ones I wanted to do , I'll have to have to go for something a bit random . {vocalsound} Does it look like a dog actually ? {vocalsound} Okay . And also , my drawing skill isn't that great so , yeah . Well , as you can see , the quality of the work today is um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Mm . I think it's outstandingly good . {vocalsound} {gap} {vocalsound} Okay , now I'm gonna have to change what is was originally gonna be {vocalsound} because that looks like a beak now , so . {vocalsound} Yeah , it can be a crocodile , it can be a crocodile . Crocodile ? Gonna be a bird . Is it gonna be {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Well it was it was an {disfmarker} at first {disfmarker} {vocalsound} it's gonna be a bird . firstly it was an attempt at a T_ Rex and then it sort of changed into a pelican O but it can be a crocodile now actually {vocalsound} . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} That's lovely . Yeah and uh I'll have to think on the spot of uh things that it is . Um Beauti that's {disfmarker} uh scary , uh strong , yeah that's about it I think {vocalsound} . Okay {vocalsound} it's fine . {vocalsound} Okay . Um , I'm very impressed with your artistic skills , Uh uh {disfmarker} mine's {disfmarker} are dreadful . Oops this is now coming apart , let me just put the top in . Wo {vocalsound} I hope that clicks in , I'll just {disfmarker} I'll hold it on , okay . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Oops , oh dear , what happened there ? Technical help . Hmm . Hopefully that'll stay on , two-handed version . Okay . Okay , uh {disfmarker} Again this is off the top of my head , I was gonna do a big cat too , um . Uh {disfmarker} Hmm . Oh dear , it doesn't look what like what I want it to be {vocalsound} . S Uh {disfmarker} Uh . {gap} It's not a vampire bat honestly {vocalsound} . {vocalsound} Okay , yeah . Uh and somewhere there's a body behind . Okay , some sort of bird {vocalsound} That's my dreadful {disfmarker} that's the worst yet , that's {disfmarker} it's meant to be an eagle {vocalsound} A seagu Eagle , okay . right , Ah eagle , right okay . not a seagull {vocalsound} . you can tell it's a flying animal {vocalsound} could have been a seagull , I never thought of a seagull . An eagle , um again I'm thinking on my feet goodness . I suppose they're all so independent , I'd put that one down again . {vocalsound} Da dum um . They're good at golf . Indepen independent , right , did you say they're good at golf ? {vocalsound} Eagle . Yeah , no yeah , Are they ? an eagle . Oh . Oh right , okay , {vocalsound} I'm not good at golf . {gap} {vocalsound} I'd say they're quite free-spirited , flying around everywhere , doing their own thing . And uh , birds of prey aren't they , Mm-hmm . oh dear , intrepid . I'll put that , intrepid . {vocalsound} There we go , That's lovely . hope that pen's gonna be okay . {vocalsound} Whoops . {vocalsound} Okay . That was fun , right . Um finance-wise , we've got a selling price at twenty five Euros , which I don't actually know what that is in Pounds , at all . Any ideas ? It's about {disfmarker} One point four or something like that . mm , mm yeah . Seventeen . One point four Euro would make a Pound or something like that . Yeah , yeah , something like that , Yeah . so that {disfmarker} D fifteen ? yeah about seventeen , seventeen Pounds , something like that . Seventeen . Seventeen Pounds . Okay , that's expensive . Should we be making notes of this ? We can just refer to this later can't we ? I think so , I think so , But {disfmarker} I'll be able to um pull it up , Yeah , okay . or I could put it in the shared folder or something . Havi having said that though , if you wanna get one of those {disfmarker} the the ones on the market at the moment they're s they're about twenty pounds anyway . Okay . So , it'd still be {disfmarker} Really ? Right . yeah , we had to buy one {vocalsound} . So Mm . I think {disfmarker} so I suppose later it depends if we want to undercut the price , we d or or is it going to make our product look a cheapie-cheapie option ? Yeah , um production cost's at twelve fifty , so Hmm . Okay , pretty huge margin . half of the selling price is taken up by building it . Yeah . Mm . Um , and profit aim is fifty million Euros , Mm-hmm . which is uh {disfmarker} In our first year ? Yi yes , um yeah , I presume so . Um {disfmarker} Mm-hmm . So then {disfmarker} You've got market range international and you did say earlier it's got to be a {disfmarker} um accessible and usable by sort of all age groups Mm-hmm . just t we're not focusing on business market , any particular thing , it's everyone No , yeah . {disfmarker} user-friendly to everyone . Okay . So {disfmarker} Big target group {vocalsound} . yes , yes , I don't think we have to {disfmarker} I don't think it's a case of worrying about different languages and things like that , um making that a key point , No . just that it's going to be in the international market like Australia , America , things like that . Mm . Okay . What are your experiences with remote controls ? I mean I've got {disfmarker} we got um {disfmarker} we had three videos , a T_V_ and a sort of amp thing all set up Mm-hmm . so we got one of the universal remote controls , um that you programme each of your things into , Yeah . Yeah , Yeah . Alright . that c but that kept losing the signals so we'd have to re-programme it every now and again . I think it was quite a cheapie as well , so that might have had something to do with it , Yeah uh . Mm-hmm . but that was quite good , the fact that you could {disfmarker} You didn't have six remote controls sitting in front of you . Use all the ones at the same time . Right . Okay , you wanna integrate everything into one like {disfmarker} Yeah , Okay . Mm-hmm . 'cause you {disfmarker} My experience has only been being given the remote control with the object I buy , not doing any tampering with it and programming , using it to programme T_V_ and uh uh videos and things . But basically on , off , volume up and down , channel one , two , th that basic functions , Mm . I don't think I could go any further with it than that , so , I suppose it's got to be something usable by someone like me as well . Yeah , the main {disfmarker} that's the main stuff anyway , I mean Mm-hmm . {disfmarker} and you don't want to {disfmarker} I hate I hate looking at a control and seeing a million tiny little buttons with tiny little words saying what they all do Mm . and just sitting there searching for the teletext button or something like that . Yeah . Mm . And symbols that you don't necessarily understand , Yeah . symbols you're meant to understand that you don't . So simplification of symbols you could think of . {vocalsound} Um . When they're {disfmarker} when you've got the main things on the front of it and a section opens up or something to the other functions where you can do sound or options kind of recording , things like that inside it . Oh yeah . Mm-hmm . 'Cause it doesn't make {disfmarker} when you pick it up it doesn't make it really complicated to look at , Mm . it's obvious what you're doing , um . Mm-hmm . Mm . Actually that just raises a point , I wonder what our design people think , but you know on a mobile phone , you can press a key and it gives you a menu , it's got a menu display , Mm-hmm . Menu , alright . I wonder if incorporating that into the design of a remote control might be useful , Yeah . Uh uh {disfmarker} so you've got a little L_C_D_ display . Right , I was thinking on the same lines you , instead of having too many b buttons and make it complicated for the user , may h maybe have an L_C_D_ di display or something like that , like a mobile , yeah and with menus . With menus , yeah , yeah . And if it's s somewhat similar to what you have on mobile phone , people might find it easier to browse and navigate also maybe . Yeah . What about the older generation ? What about granny and grandads ? {vocalsound} You mean to save it lesser number . Um , my grandad can answer his mobile phone , but he couldn't even dream of texting or something like that . Yeah . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Can he programme his remote control or is it basic with that too ? Right . I don't think they tape things , Yeah , my grandad's actually better than me at using teletext , so {vocalsound} I don't think they use {disfmarker} Right . Right . So that's a problem regardless of of any design modifications you you come up with , Yeah . that's gonna be a problem anyway with the older generation perhaps , Mm , yeah , the age gap . Yeah , what it just needs to be {disfmarker} as long as it's sort of self-intuitive and you can can work out what everything's doing , 'cause I mean , menus on sort of new phones now they've sort of got all these pictures and stuff which makes it fairly obvious what you're trying to do . Mm . Mm-hmm . I don't know , I d But I don't know how {disfmarker} I don't like the , you know the new phones that have kind of got a Windows-based running system . Oh yeah . Mm-hmm . I find it really confusing , I kept getting lost {vocalsound} in the phone , I di I've not got a new one but uh my friend got a new one Right . and I was trying to do things with it and I just kept getting lost , but that's just me . Yeah , I don't I don't know how for twenty fi , or twelve Euros fifty how much of a excellent screen you could get , {vocalsound} Yeah . you'd you'd have to sort of keep it down to a black and white L_C_D_ thing anyway , I'd assume . Mm-hmm . Is it possible that that for the older generation you could have like an extra button that you press for large print like you do in large print books ? Okay . Teletext has got that option as well . Obviously it displays less on the screen , it displays less on the screen but as long as they can read it that's the main thing . Yeah . Or what about kind of a dual function ? In that you've got the basic buttons just for your play , volume , programme things Mm-hmm . and also {disfmarker} and then a menu to go into with obvious pictures , obvious symbols and that's where you control recording and things like that . {vocalsound} Yeah . Mm-hmm . Mm . The other thing is , just ch chucking into mobile phone f design features again , it could have a flip top remote control so that when you flip over the top , your screen is {disfmarker} you can have a bigger screen in the the flip over . Mm-hmm . Mm , okay . S I think that's a cost thing , I don't I don't know how much we're gonna know about {disfmarker} Y It might Yeah ? it might save a b bit of space , it's i instead of looking bulky , it might look small . Mm-hmm . Yes , no that's important . But it might have its cost implications . Yeah . Yeah , like smaller . Okay . And there's no reason we need to make it look as fashionable and stylish as a mobile phone , it can still be lightweight plastic , you know ? Mm . Right . Something that's easily moulded and produced . Yeah . Sorry I'm treading on your territory guys . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Um , right , okay No uh uh {disfmarker} we've got half an hour before the next meeting , so we're all gonna go off and do our individual things . Um I think that's probably about it and then we'll come back and liaise again and I get to do another fantastic PowerPoint presentation . Yeah . Just just a quick thing about the um {vocalsound} Sure . about what you're saying about the uh {disfmarker} does does it need to be fashionable ? The sort of {disfmarker} I I had a quick look at the company website and it's like the the uh {disfmarker} we put the fashion into electronics , so I think think the whole design thing might be qui Ah right . Okay . Okay . Okay . I mean you don't {disfmarker} you you can still have plastic Sure b y yeah . and it'd look quite good but {disfmarker} But {disfmarker} yeah , I mean it doesn't have to be that , you know {vocalsound} th that was my main point , Yeah . we don't have to use metal , I don't know if using plastic does make it cheaper , Mm . I presume it would . I would {disfmarker} Yeah . Yeah . Yeah , yeah , yeah . it would probably . I mean there's Sky remote controls and everything . They're kind of moulded and look a bit different , and the Telewest remote controls are silver plastic , which looks a bit smarter , Right . so yeah I guess that's stuff we can think about . Okay . Okay , so let's break it up there . Okay ? Okay . 'Kay . So , see you in half an hour . Do we go back to our room ? Yep ? Mm , yeah . I think so , yeah .",
        "summarize": "Project Manager introduced a new remote control project. The team started to know each other by drawing favourite animals. Project Manager proposed to price each remote control at 25 Euros, considering the 12.5-Euro production cost. The market range would be international and over all age groups. After the financial targets, the team discussed the remote design. Despite the \"one-for-all\" style, the remote was still supposed to be user-friendly. Standard features such as sorting through channels and adjusting volume would not lose their priority. The team, therefore, agreed on a style of basic buttons with a self-intuitive screen menu. Silver lightweight plastic was temporarily decided to be the material, for it is easily moulded and cost-saving."

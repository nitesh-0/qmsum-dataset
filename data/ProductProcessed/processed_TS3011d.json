        "transcript": "That's the same as uh on the top of it uh with the the round uh button . Like this one . But uh we don't uh we don't uh {disfmarker} we do think it's um well {disfmarker} what if with ease of use , w which prefers the {disfmarker} which the the customer of the user prefers . It's important . Uh I think th this is device which which has a learning curve . Um novice users u use this device as uh normal users use uh a c a remote control . And after a while they start to develop uh some skills in the the voice recognition functions , and then they will not use this dial as often . But other users who are new to this device need something like that . Okay . They n they need to understand what {disfmarker} uh how to change channels and uh change the volume , so it's easier for them Could could I see the scroll bar as uh as as a sort of shortcut ? A a and the voice recognition as well , Yeah , maybe so . Yes , it's {disfmarker} th maybe you could uh could uh {disfmarker} Well , it's it's it's another approach , it's more that our um {gap} . {vocalsound} There are there are many ways of doing uh things uh on such a device . {vocalsound} Yeah . It's it's quite easy . Okay . Okay , good . And and the case is is rubber ? Yes , rubber ? And the buttons ? {vocalsound} Plastic or rubber . {vocalsound} There are plastic or rubber . Well , Okay , yeah . and uh the colouring ? Uh yellow with uh {gap} with with grey or black . grey or black or something like that . Whatever cost uh cost uh the least . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Okay , {vocalsound} we'll we'll come to that later . Um {vocalsound} okay . Anything else to add or {disfmarker} No . {vocalsound} Uh maybe we should uh think about these buttons . Yeah . {vocalsound} But {disfmarker} Well , you could use two of them to programme the um channels on the two channel button , Yes , but it {disfmarker} 'cause you have to assign two channel {disfmarker} new channels . but these are tasks that are only executed once , I think . M uh yeah . Or not ? M m but maybe you do want a programme button to uh for example activate the voice recognition , or train the voice voice recognition . You {disfmarker} Well okay . Okay , yeah , that's right . Or something li like that . And a button for disabling the voice recognition . Yeah al although by pressing the button for I n don't know two , three seconds , you could also say it {disfmarker} you'd disable it with a little beep and and {disfmarker} Yes . Yeah . but o okay , that that's not really really important . {vocalsound} That's the basic idea , yeah . Of our prototype . {vocalsound} The basic {disfmarker} okay . Okay . Um you thought of some evaluation crit criteria ? Yes . Okay . Uh my name is not name {vocalsound} You are nameless . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} but {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Uh well , I used the {gap} {disfmarker} the uh {gap} documents . And these uh were the most important criteria . {vocalsound} Is it spongy ? {vocalsound} It should be . {gap} {disfmarker} {vocalsound} yeah , {vocalsound} {vocalsound} that's uh how the fashion guys uh state it . Fancy look and feel . So {disfmarker} So just walk through it step by step . I mean , is it fancy , everything {disfmarker} I believe uh I believe it's fancy . {vocalsound} Uh well appar I believe it's fancy too . Yeah , but apparently uh we shouldn't evaluate yet . No . Oh , sorry . So {disfmarker} Okay , so Okay . this {disfmarker} these are the cr uh the criteria . Yeah , I think these are the most important criteria . Okay , well {disfmarker} So uh the then we'll switch to my presentation . Um {disfmarker} that's about it . The production costs . The costs are not under {disfmarker} Can I {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Um this is the {disfmarker} Twenty two . Yeah , it's it's w way above um uh above the the the twelve Euro fifty . Yikes . And what makes it very expensive is uh for example the solar cell . So I guess we should skip that , Well it's very expensive . because it's not that important . Okay . Why does the price and and the s oh , one uh exa Yeah , the the price , the the number of items and the the sum . yeah . The number of uh {disfmarker} yeah . {vocalsound} Okay . Um well , this is what I would call our luxury model . Um if you would {disfmarker} And and does it {disfmarker} if you look at the uh w w w what we could do to make it more um {vocalsound} to make it {vocalsound} just between the twelve Euro fifty , um then I did the following changes . Twelve Euro forty cents I came up with by leaving out the solar cells , um by not using the voice recognition feature , Mm-hmm . because it's uh it's a four Euro uh addition to the price . Mm-hmm . Um {disfmarker} Yeah , I believe {disfmarker} Uh , push-button , well {disfmarker} {vocalsound} It makes it the thirteen {disfmarker} yeah . Push-buttons are {disfmarker} buttons are are not the most expensive , but do add extra cost . Hmm . So um {disfmarker} yeah , th this design is not um within our price model . Okay . Um {disfmarker} But I'm afraid it's not complete . Because we use spec uh specic uh special materials , the last item . And you have not added one item there . Yeah . So it's c way too expensive . It's still too expensive , yeah . Um {disfmarker} But that's that's only for the buttons . I I guess if we leave the {disfmarker} if we leave this one out , um {disfmarker} So the button we can use plastic . oh . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} And uh maybe not use the special form . And the pla uh {disfmarker} And a plastic b just plastic buttons , a plas uh instead of rubber . But it {disfmarker} {vocalsound} It becomes a very dull remote control , I know . Yes . But it's the board decision . Um {disfmarker} And um {disfmarker} yeah . Well , b basically it {vocalsound} {disfmarker} when when this is our only option , we should even consider changing the casing , because I think there's very little added value in uh an enhanced case with these dull functions . Yeah . Yeah , I know . Maybe we should look at an {disfmarker} uh focus on another uh {disfmarker} So {disfmarker} Type of m maybe another market segment . Yeah , m uh maybe not not all that fancy , but just way way more easy uh uh um basic Yeah . and uh m maximise the profits Yes . and um {disfmarker} That's {disfmarker} maybe that's better . {vocalsound} Yeah . Maybe we could uh {disfmarker} we should go for straight and simple , Yeah . but that's not what uh has been asked . I know , I know . So we should kick the board's uh {vocalsound} {disfmarker} Well {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Yeah . Although I think we {disfmarker} yeah , but we could still make uh a remote control that ap uh um applies um more to young people uh by giving it another colour already . Hmm . Um so it is possible to make uh uh a device that attracts a little bit more to young people . Yes . Um but uh I agree it's it's not a fancy high-tech uh device . Definitely not , no . {vocalsound} It's not that innovative . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Or however you s pronounce that . Yeah , too bad . {vocalsound} Um so , okay . {vocalsound} Um {disfmarker} Oh , {vocalsound} this is the wrong one . So uh that means redesign . {vocalsound} We do not have the time o uh now to to redesign the product . Mm-hmm . Um {vocalsound} but we can evaluate the process and um uh uh the satisfaction on how things went . Um I'm not sure if we need to evaluate uh the device first . I guess {disfmarker} Um well , since we're not gonna manufacture it anyway {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah , that's true . Well , maybe it's good to do it anyway , because if we evaluate it , we we can also determine if our objectives are good . We l we can learn . Yeah . Yeah . I agree . So {disfmarker} Well {disfmarker} Is it fancy ? {vocalsound} I d it is it is {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Yay . Is it ? Is it fancy ? Yeah , I think so . Um the yellow rubber , I think so . I think so . {vocalsound} You like the rubber , uh Roo . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} I'm into it . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} So uh one ? Yeah . But it's not that fancy . No , I'll I'll I'll give it a two . I mean I think uh {disfmarker} I think it would have been more fancy if we used the titanium housing {disfmarker} the casing . It would be even more {disfmarker} You like tita {vocalsound} {vocalsound} oh , you really like titanium . I'm I'm into it . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} That's a flavour as well . {vocalsound} It has flavour . Yes , that's right . {vocalsound} You should taste it . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Right . Um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Yeah , I know , Is it uh {disfmarker} but but it {disfmarker} but that's fancy in the way um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I mean fancy has has a lot of {disfmarker} It has to do with fashion , I guess . Yeah . It's trendy trendy , fun {disfmarker} {vocalsound} So do {disfmarker} And w yeah . yeah , w what they want {disfmarker} wanted was uh colours and soft materials . Yeah . So in that way {disfmarker} It {disfmarker} it's fancy . It applies . It {disfmarker} yeah . Well , just {vocalsound} give it a two . Okay . Yeah . Yes . It's not the ultimate uh fancy two , but {disfmarker} I think I th I think it would have been {disfmarker} I would have think {disfmarker} uh it could have been more fancy by using the double-curved case . It would have been even more fancy , but we decided not to , because if we use a double-curved case , we could not use solar . Yeah , but that's sti that's uh {disfmarker} So {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Looking at the user uh needs , we only uh don't {disfmarker} we don't have the double-curved case . We w we do have uh the rubber , we do have the colours . That's two out of three . So I believe uh we are close uh to two . Yes . Yeah , I I agree . Yes , I agree too . It's okay . We did {gap} {disfmarker} yes , we did good . Okay , and uh was it innovative ? {vocalsound} Well , {vocalsound} with the voice recognition feature and uh {disfmarker} But that's not in it . Ov or can we {disfmarker} Yep . No , we are evaluating this this uh design now . This prototype . Well , let's let's {disfmarker} this product . Okay . So I I I think it is . I think it's innovative . Yeah . {vocalsound} And the scroll uh wheel . The solar {disfmarker} not many remotes have the solar , I think . No . It could have been a little bit more innovative u by using the kinetic uh energy source , but it's it's way too {disfmarker} Yeah , and uh {disfmarker} That would have been a thrill . yes , but {disfmarker} So uh also a uh two ? I think uh it's a two . Yep . Is it easy to use ? I'm not sure . {vocalsound} I'm not sure . Yeah . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Well yeah , the voice recognition of course is hard to learn , I think . Well , hard {disfmarker} it's not for the for the e for the elderly . They won't use it . {vocalsound} Well , but there are two parts in this remote control . What you see here is is the basic part . Everybody can use it , so that's easy to use . Yeah . That's for a novice user . When you have a more advanced , elaborate user , well , such a user really would like to explore all these additional functions . So in that in that way it is advanced , Yeah . and I think it's easy to use for for both uh types of users . I think {disfmarker} I think a three . So uh {disfmarker} It's maybe {disfmarker} it's not very uh easy for {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Wouldn't give it more . Uh I'm doubting {disfmarker} doubting as well . Um {disfmarker} Well the p the most important function is easy to use . The the zapping , channel switching , volume . But the more advanced functions are probably a bit harder . Okay . Uh two or three ? Three ? Wha wh what would be your guess ? I mean ease of use um does not only apply to the most basic functions . Okay . It's the uh it's it's overall . Is the device easy to use ? Yeah , that's right . You're right in that , but I {gap} {disfmarker} I guess uh an advanced user will will find the voice recognition function easy to use , Yeah . because he is already {disfmarker} he or she is already an advanced user . Yeah . So {disfmarker} Um {disfmarker} Okay . After all , I think {disfmarker} personally I would give a two . But {disfmarker} Uh Roo , a three ? Yep . Ruud ? Good question . Uh I'll go uh for the two . Okay . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} So , it's two , two and three . Two threes . So that's ten . So I could make it e easy ? If you make it a four it will be three in general . So that's w No , two and a half . If he makes it a four . Not a three . Six and four . Six and four is ten . Divided by four is two and a half . So {disfmarker} Darn . Nee . Yes . {vocalsound} Hmm ? Huh ? Roo . {vocalsound} A seven , a three {disfmarker} {vocalsound} No . Yeah . I yeah {gap} . A four and a three together . {vocalsound} Four ? Yeah , you have a two , he has a two . Three ? Yeah , Two ? two , two , three {disfmarker} No , And a three ? I haven't said anything yet . Nee . I know . No . {vocalsound} Okay , but if I would say a three , then it's six , and four is ten . Divided by four is two point five . Divided by four . Yes . So if you want to have the conclusion as a three {disfmarker} three . Then you would make a four . If you fill out a four {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} But I'm filling in a three . That's not even {disfmarker} Does it {disfmarker} will {disfmarker} so it will be a two point five . {vocalsound} But that's not possible to fill in , Yes , it is . so we have to round it . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Is it easy to find ? {vocalsound} {vocalsound} I have a veto . {vocalsound} Exactly . It's not about the content , it's about {disfmarker} okay , um is it easy to f Yeah , definitely . Yeah , Yes . we haven't re uh re uh really worked it out , but you c you can you can just say find and he repeats find . It it most definitely is {disfmarker} it's very easy . Yeah , or beeps or {disfmarker} yeah . Yeah , but that's the that's the the basic idea of the the speaker uh {disfmarker} Yes . Maybe {disfmarker} Uh I I think I think {disfmarker} I'm here , I'm here . {vocalsound} something like that . Maybe you have to uh programme it once , so to that l respond to uh a certain word or a certain sentence , something like where are you , and then it will sing I'm here . So something like that . Yeah . Yeah . But even without it {disfmarker} Yeah . {vocalsound} Well , I uh {disfmarker} So , I th we should not uh stay too long on this subject uh because of the time , but I personally give it a one . Yeah . Um Sebastian ? {vocalsound} Yeah , me too . Me too . Yeah , I agree . Right , well . The feel of the remote control is spongy . Well , uh {vocalsound} it can't be more spongy . So {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Well , it can be . There are cases um in which the outside casing is {disfmarker} um can be {disfmarker} uh how d how do you prono is is moldable . Was it one of our options ? No , it's not one of our option , No . Uh No okay , but but So , in the in {disfmarker} but when you look in the market , when you look {disfmarker} this this was a most spongy option . {vocalsound} for the options given , it's the most spongy one . Uh yes , Yeah . but that's not that's not uh what they are talking about , I think . Because we compare all these uh characteristics {disfmarker} characteristics with uh market {disfmarker} uh with with the real market . Yeah . Yeah . So there are uh remote controls out there which are a lot more spongy . They're out there . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} They're out there . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} But I think in this case in this case we've done the best we could . {vocalsound} Yeah . Yes , but it's not good enough , {vocalsound} I'll give it a one . so it's a two . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} I wan I'll take one . You take one ? What do you give it ? Well yeah , it depends , 'cause it's the most spongy we could {disfmarker} Yeah , I know , but you have to name a fig uh a number . {vocalsound} but {disfmarker} yeah . Because we need to go on {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} for the time . Well , if I give it a one there'll be one hell of a calculation . It will be a one . {vocalsound} So I'll just give it a two and make this a one point five . No no no . Uh I'll I'll change it , I'll make it m my my mark will be a four . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} You are {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} okay . {vocalsound} The remote control offers enough features . {vocalsound} Well , Ruud , what what do you think about it ? Well , the basic layout doesn't offem {disfmarker} offer much , but the voice recognition could add a lot . So {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Basically it's it's completely programmable . Yeah , depends . Yeah . You can add very m much functionality by uh using the voice recognition mode . Yeah , I know . So it's quite advanced . What what we didn't talk about is um uh {disfmarker} Yeah , but {vocalsound} it ha doesn't has the digits . I believe it's {disfmarker} If you uh ask yourself it offers enough features , I don't I don't think it is {disfmarker} it has all the features um a normal remote has . I think it has . Uh depends on what you uh implement in the speech feat Yeah . Bec because you can um {disfmarker} we didn't talk about it , but you do have uh remote controls that are able to adapt another signal . So , Yes . you place a a regular uh remote control in front of the other one , hit the one or the two or the three , whatever , and it r records the uh the um {gap} {disfmarker} the the signals . Has uh the signals sent to it . Yeah . Signal . So you could uh uh uh enter any comment you like , as long it's able to {disfmarker} as long as our device is able to reproduce the infrared signal . So I think th this uh this is uh a a remote control with a very high level of features . Absolutely . Although there are i a few buttons , but the inside is is quite uh advanced . Yes . But that {disfmarker} that's its power , I guess , because uh a regular programmable uh remote control contains , well , uh really a lot of buttons . At at least uh forty buttons . Yeah . Yeah . So it's it's quite s complicated to get uh to get used to . And this is quite s simple . Yep . You can use your voice to to programme it . It's {disfmarker} Yeah . Okay , um let's give it a number . I'll give it uh a one . For for the {disfmarker} for this t uh type of market , I think it's a one . I'll give a two . {vocalsound} Yeah , I'll give it a one . Um I think think a one , 'cause {gap} v with a voice recognition you could add anything you want , so that's like um {disfmarker} Yes . I I've {disfmarker} I think we've uh succe succeed in in developing a product that's actually quite good , but not for this kind of market , and not for this kind of price . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah . So {disfmarker} So high quality , low acceptance . Hmm . The product is is is uh b high qua uh has a high quality and and is uh advanced . But {vocalsound} whether or not our clients are are um willing to pay twenty five Euros for this kind of device is doub is {disfmarker} well , is not sure . Yes . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . D do you agree ? Yes , I agree . I {disfmarker} Maybe even because it doesn't look advanced . {vocalsound} Yeah . Maybe we should have a radar uh {vocalsound} function . {vocalsound} Yeah , okay . {vocalsound} But {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Yes . But we could {disfmarker} couldn't uh {disfmarker} what what's the selling price ? Fifty ? Twenty five Euros . Uh twenty five . And costs were twelve fifty . Yeah . But even now , if only our production costs w {vocalsound} uh were exceeded the double , Think . Production cost was {disfmarker} were t uh was twenty two ? Mm-hmm . So uh {gap} selling price uh would be uh {disfmarker} M about fifty Euros . yeah . That's quite ex That's price , but w w well , it's not it's not very expensive for a remote control that that has this functionality . No . An original remote control of any T_V_ kind , uh a Phillips remote control , y you pay uh {disfmarker} Yes , it's more than fifty Euros . It's quite expensive , yes . Yeah , I kn I know uh from a few years ago , it it it costed hundred Gilders . Bu but {disfmarker} well {disfmarker} yeah , I know , but you're paying for th for the brand , because there are uh remote controls which control your stereo , television , D_V_D_ , C_D_ player , for under twenty five Euros . Yes . Yes , but you can you c Yes , but you can learn this thing , all these functions . Yeah . And it's easier to use because those uh remote controls don't offer voice recognition {gap} . and this one does . Yeah . So I think it's worth its price . Okay . Um you had an overall rating . Um {disfmarker} Yeah , but uh {vocalsound} with these ratings uh That's counting . Well , it's it's about one point five . Something like that . should be about one point s seven , Four six seven eight . yeah . Okay . Nine divided by six . Okay . Um we'll go further on with the the rest of the evaluation . About the project itself , not about the product . Um {disfmarker} What did you think about uh the process , the project process ? Ruud ? {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Try to translate that . {vocalsound} Well {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Hmm . {vocalsound} Any any other {disfmarker} Uh , Roo ? Yeah , I think uh {disfmarker} Well , I think {disfmarker} Ye {vocalsound} Roo . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} The process was good . {vocalsound} But w um we weren't aware of the prices of the costs . Yeah . And and that was the the big deal . I if we knew that before , we c we could have made Mm . Actually , we had {disfmarker} the the choice between {gap} what {disfmarker} Better decision . Yes . yeah . We had we had too little information actually . Yeah . So {disfmarker} And uh um the the the {disfmarker} well , looking at room for creativity , there was w way too {disfmarker} the the choice of components was way too narrow . Less . Yeah . So there was not really a process of uh {disfmarker} So we could we we could be {disfmarker} we could've been creative . But um it was tempered by the choice of components and the the price . Well {disfmarker} Yes . The prices . Well , in the first meeting we we already were very creative . Yeah . We we thought of possibilities {vocalsound} who are not possible uh with the the current uh offer of uh manufacturing components . So {disfmarker} Yeah . We're tempered by that , yes . Okay , Roo ? Any other thoughts on that ? No , no . Ruud ? I agree . You agree , okay . Uh leadership . Fantastic . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Okay , Roo's on for his promotion . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah , {gap} okay . Okay . I think we're a good team . I think so too , it's it's it's uh of course a laboratory environment . I missed it um to be able to contact you in between and uh say uh , hey Roo uh {gap} . {vocalsound} Um {disfmarker} Yeah . Yes . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Well , I tried once , but that was not allowed . {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} So um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah , but but si uh w w w {gap} {disfmarker} when taken in account the the situation , uh I think we performed pretty well . I think so too . Yeah . Um Yeah . the means , the SMARTboard , the digital pen . Did you like 'em ? {vocalsound} Uh . The digital pen was okay , but SMARTboard was really bad . Yeah . Because of the response It {disfmarker} it's {disfmarker} or {disfmarker} Response The response is very slow and {disfmarker} and the possibilities are very limited . It's not accurate . Okay . Uh {disfmarker} Uh it it has {disfmarker} yeah . Yeah , it's not accurate . The p the pointing of the pen is not um the place where it it writes its {disfmarker} um uh where it uh {disfmarker} Draws . Yeah , where it draws . It's uh {disfmarker} the drawing on on the b on the board is {gap} r right from the pen . Okay , so So uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} it it had to be um better aligned , or what's the word ? You to take in account that your {disfmarker} you m Uh yeah . yeah uh {disfmarker} Maybe it's {disfmarker} it needs to be calibrateds . It's too slow {disfmarker} It it was calibrated just before this meeting . Uh the one before , the third meeting . It is ? So uh it's not the calibration , Okay . it's the thing itself , I think . Hmm . Okay . Uh Ruud , w uh did you use the pen a lot ? Or not at all ? No . Not at all . Not really . Okay . I thought it was quite a handy uh thing , I I think so too . although I would like to see um O_C_R_ . Yep . Yes . Yes . If it has O_C_R_ {vocalsound} , uh I think uh I would use , but uh I I just uh took notes for myself and and and that's it . Yeah . It w it w yeah . It was necessary for me to uh {disfmarker} To digitise them . Yeah , because if I want something on the computer , I just type it . Yeah . I type faster than I write . Mm-hmm . Yeah . So {disfmarker} But I think it's a great solution for uh for uh a known problem , uh writing down some notes , some some inf uh information , and then um forgetting your notebook somewhere and losing all that information . Yeah . Because you have everything in one place and it's quite easy quite easy {disfmarker} it's it's possible to make this information digital and share it with others in a quite easy way . Yeah . I think it's a good product . I only think it's th the the shape of the pen is too big . Yeah . It's not quite uh ergonomic . Eco ergonomic . Economic . I know . {vocalsound} Yeah . Okay . Um {disfmarker} What w Uh Ruud , what did you think about the SMARTboards ? Oh , I only use it to draw a rabbit , Yeah . Okay , you can't really decide . No . {vocalsound} so {disfmarker} {vocalsound} can't say much about it . I missed a feature to easily select uh a slide and uh distribute it to the laptops . I think that would be very easy if you could say okay , I want to use this for my own work or my own presentation further on or {disfmarker} Yeah . Yes . No , or the other way around . Or the other way around , that you could show {disfmarker} but m Yes , yes . But y you can {disfmarker} That's quite what PowerPoint does . Yeah . I know . if you save this image , you can open it in your shared work folder . I know , but {disfmarker} So it's almost {disfmarker} I know , but we couldn't use that feature , yeah . so I missed it . Yep . We weren't able to do that . At least the {disfmarker} um I wasn't explained how to do such a th Mm-hmm . {gap} . A and the function of of filling an an uh an oval or an an object . An object , yes . Yes . I it's not possible {disfmarker} The drawing cap capabilities are very limited . yeah . Okay . And and uh w you were {disfmarker} when you're using uh Windows , you're used to a certain interface and certain buttons , uh which you can use for drawing . Yeah . And a lot of these buttons don't appear here . So it's {disfmarker} Oh it looks like paint actually . Okay , so y it {disfmarker} it's not even as advanced as paint . Not not uh n not {gap} way . Yeah . {vocalsound} It's quite uh limited . Okay . Uh no . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah , the project is evaluated . Um but , well , we need to redesign uh the product . Okay . Oh , very good , celebration . Celebrate Great . {vocalsound} Pop uh pop up the champagne . {vocalsound} Okay . {vocalsound} Um It was a privilege working with you . {vocalsound} you're dismissed . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} No , I think we are uh ready . Okay . To private rooms ? {vocalsound} I see some action over there . Private room , Roo . That sounds quite scary . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Okay .

        "summarize": "This is the fourth meeting of the design group. The group firstly introduced a prototype which contained the characteristics determined at the last meeting. Then Project Manager pointed out that since the production costs were over budget, they should reduce costs by leaving out solar cells, not using voice recognition and changing the button material into plastics. Then the group went through the evaluation criteria of the product. They thought the remote control should be fancy, innovative, easy to use, easy to find and spongy and evaluated the prototype with these criteria. When evaluating the project, the group considered that it was tempered by the choice of components and the price. Eventually, the group decided to redesign the product."

        "transcript": "Okay . So , now um , {vocalsound} last time . Can you uh {vocalsound} push the button ? {vocalsound} One time please . So {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I'm still the secretary . Now uh , I ask you to presentate the prototype . One of your {disfmarker} you two . {vocalsound} I don't care . {vocalsound} Oh this , you mean ? Yes . The prototype . Huh ? Yes , well uh this is it . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} This is it . Well , thank you . Uh , now {disfmarker} It's uh it's uh it's yellow . And uh , this is rubber . And and and this too . The {vocalsound} the sides . Yes . And the rest is hard plastic . And uh {disfmarker} We uh we had some uh {vocalsound} {disfmarker} We had a new idea {vocalsound} that that this can uh can be uh uh turned inside . {vocalsound} And then it covers the {disfmarker} these buttons Okay . until here or something . Yes . And then you can still use the the power button and the mute and the the joystick . Mm-hmm . So , you can still operate uh all the things . Because you don't always use the menu . And then it can break . Okay . And the buttons ? Uh , well uh {disfmarker} Big . {vocalsound} Big buttons . And everything is blue , except the power button . And the mute . Of uh {disfmarker} yeah , and the mute and the the other button . {vocalsound} Yeah . Channel higher channel button . {gap} . Yeah . And the joystick is for the volume and the channels . Uh , yes . Yes , Yes . that's uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Very obvious . {vocalsound} Up is channel up . Down is channel down . To the right is volume up . To the left is volume down . Yeah . Okay , so if joystick and L_C_D_ . What's the R_R_ {gap} d {vocalsound} R_R_'s the l the the the the company uh logo . The R_R_ ? Okay . Very good . {vocalsound} So , we have {disfmarker} That's on the rub rubber part . Uh , yes . Yes . That's about here . So , what they say on the side is put fashion there . Yes . It's good . Oh . So , that's it . That's prototype . Yeah ? Now , the finance . {vocalsound} We don't know if it's {disfmarker} th it {disfmarker} if it's okay . Alright . {vocalsound} So , I'm gonna look . Do we {disfmarker} We have {disfmarker} Do we change the {disfmarker} Sorry ? Do we change the the order ? Or are we going to uh ev evaluate it first ? Finance is um {disfmarker} Yeah it's {disfmarker} No , first uh {disfmarker} Yes . We have to evaluate the product yet . Okay . Sorry . That's uh um {disfmarker} {gap} That can be none . Um , we gonna do the evaluation now , together . But I have uh a introduction how it works . So , it will come up . Uh-oh . Okay . Um , yeah . Well , we uh {disfmarker} uh , I have um thinked a few evaluation uh criterias , uh based on um our marketing strategy , on uh the latest trends , on user preferences . Uh , we have a seven point scale from uh true , as well . To false , seven ? And on base of each c uh criteria , we need to um give a rating . We can uh {disfmarker} Well , it look like this . But we gonna uh do it here , they said . {vocalsound} So , you hope found out how to do it with a Word document . Yeah . Okay , yeah . Yeah . Um , well uh we have the Word document {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Criteria . You {disfmarker} {gap} So we open up that blank here . Um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Think I can {disfmarker} Uh , what this just an example . So , this not very important . But um , if I can get a number in here . Hmm . No , it's okay . Well , uh we can't do that . I'll get it . Oh , it's okay . Um , so uh you have to think of it as uh the remote control is techno technologically innovative . Uh , and then we have to uh agree on the rating together . And in the end , we will c uh count an average of all rating . The first uh on each item . What do you think ? Yeah , I think it's uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Uh , well technologically using , it's not uh {disfmarker} it doesn't contain many new features . Only the L_C_D_ . So , it {disfmarker} Um , I think I will give it a {disfmarker} yeah , yeah , yeah {gap} , a four . Hmm . I think the scroll-button is something also uh new . What uh {disfmarker} not anoth uh , {vocalsound} not a lot of uh {disfmarker} a lot of uh remote controls have . I think technologically I'll give it an seven . Si six six . {gap} Yeah . Sorry , six . So now i I think you uh see it {gap} um its statement . Oh , true or false . And you {gap} true or false . Oh , uh I'll I'll give it uh a t a two . And true is one . So , yeah . Yeah . Two . Sorry . You ? Three . Me too . So it's a three . 'Kay . Um , well {disfmarker} It's a one . {vocalsound} The first item . So , okay the second item . Um , this product is for all sorts of customers . Mm {disfmarker} Well , it's a statement which uh I disagree with , because we uh really aim uh at at young market and I think the way it looked uh c uh totally in yellow , it's not uh really aimed for all customers . It doesn't look like that . So it's a {disfmarker} That's uh a six . Five . Mm , four . Yes , it's for the younger g group . So it's uh half half of the people . Yeah , but it's it's {disfmarker} So I think it's four . Yeah . I mean it still has l large buttons and not m many buttons . No . So {disfmarker} I mean , the colours are for young people , Mm-hmm . but Yes . So , I think it's four . older {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Yeah . Maybe version uh three point O_ uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} has other colours . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah . Maybe . Okay . Give it a four . Four . Yep . Four . Uh , okay . Mm . We put the fashion in electronics . That's uh the motto of our company . Yeah , well do we do this with uh this product ? I um {disfmarker} Yeah . I think if we do this , as it's uh uh c uh it's really orientates on the design . Um , so I would give it a two . Me too a two , because only the battery is not uh techin uh technologically high standard . But the rest of it is . So , I think a two . {vocalsound} Yes . Two . Uh , I say uh a five . Two . It's not fashion , it's new . It must be a fashion . But it isn't . It {disfmarker} it will be fashion . Yes . It w If it's not a fashion we can put it in it . So , it must be a fashion . I think it's a five . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Okay . Then make it th three . Okay . Yes , I'll think of that too . No . Oh . 'Kay . Three is okay . Yeah , agree ? I use my feet though . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Oh , we'll wait outside . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} A three . Okay . {vocalsound} Yeah okay . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} The next element um is the product looks good . Well personally , I do not prefer a um remote control that's fully in yellow . So , I would give this a five . I give it a one . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {gap} . Yes , a one . I like it . Well , I say three . So , counting then is two and a half . {vocalsound} We have to do our uh {disfmarker} Say two . Two or three ? Okay , two . Two . Two . Okay . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} So , well we gonna do the next part . Uh , yep . Uh uh , the next statement . It has not too much buttons . Um , yeah , I I have uh said is not because uh a low number is better . And in the end we calculate an average . So , um that's why it's a negative in it . Um , well this one of our aims not have too much buttons . So , um uh did we uh do that ? Well , uh if we go to {vocalsound} uh this fashion , I {disfmarker} We still have caused uh a lot of uh buttons for the numbers . But you can you can go for that . And um that way , you don't have a lot of buttons over . So , I would give this a two . One . {vocalsound} You ? One . {vocalsound} Me too . One . One . {vocalsound} Um , but {vocalsound} where where is the {gap} ? {vocalsound} Next , six . It does not get lost easily . So {disfmarker} Yeah , did we implement uh the sound ? {vocalsound} Uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Yes . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Just a small thing . {vocalsound} No , we did not . So , but can it get lost if it's such a thing ? Yeah , but uh {disfmarker} Yeah . Ah . Yellow . I don't think so . {vocalsound} Looks like a pistol . Yes . Not a not a normal shapes . So {disfmarker} Uh {disfmarker} It won't get between uh the pillows uh on the couch . No . It won't get lost . Yeah . So {disfmarker} Uh {disfmarker} It won't . A one ? {vocalsound} Yeah . Yeah , o one . Okay , a one . One . Next . Okay , um well we aimed for the younger market . {gap} Uh yeah , did we achieve that . I think with the way it looks and um it is designed , I will give it a two . Yeah me {disfmarker} {gap} Yeah . Me too . That was our target . Two . Two . Yep . Yeah ? Yeah . Yeah . Right . There's a fancy look-and-feel . Uh , yes . That that was uh , yeah , one of the most important things that uh Trendwatch said . I didn't uh say it in my presentation . But um , well does it have that ? I would say yes . So um {disfmarker} Well , let's also give this a two . T I gave this a one because of the rubber . It feels soft . Uh , it looks like a l uh uh b uh , a bit like a joystick . It's {disfmarker} Yeah . Yeah , f very fancy {gap} trendy . Okay . Yes , a one . I say a two . It's a a bit personal . If it's fancy . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah . So I think s two is better . Yeah , okay . Two is okay . Okay . Two . {gap} . And um , then the last one I could think of , uh it goes with the latest trends . No , it's new . Innovation . If we looked at the latest trends for the uh younger people , and they ate uh fruit and vegetables , well it has a um a nice colour , uh well compared to food but we didn't uh {disfmarker} We did not paint any uh fruit and vegetable on it for something like that . Oh . So , I would {disfmarker} did not give this uh a one or two . I {disfmarker} We'll go for a three . {gap} . I go for two because uh the the shapes are still round . Uh , the latest trends are soft things , you know , like uh I said in my presentation . Uh {disfmarker} Yes . But the the colours are um basic , like yellow , red , um blue . Something what also younger people want . It's also a trend , so I'll give it a two . Okay . Mm , three . Me too . Three . A three . Yeah . Okay . So um , come back to the presentation now . So , we find yourself there , and now we have to calculate an average rating . Effort is three , ten and twelve . Thirty , forty , fifty , {gap} . So , we will do that . Yes . Twenty one . So , it's uh two and three nine two and one third . By nine . Two . Yeah . Um , uh okay . {vocalsound} Two . Yep . Come on . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Uh , nah . Okay . So uh , that's a pretty low rating , I think . {vocalsound} Yes . {vocalsound} So , it's good . So , according to our uh own evaluation uh we did a good job . {vocalsound} Okay . {vocalsound} Thank you . Yeah , I think {gap} . Oh . Nah . How am I doing ? Yes . Okay . And I closed your slide-show . Back to my uh {disfmarker} Which one was the last for you ? Uh , dreaming . Yep . Next please . Next . Finance . So , now uh we have a product . Very happy . But uh , is it cheap enough ? Um , so if uh {disfmarker} I'll have a look . We have a battery . One battery . Mm-hmm . Cheapest there is . Okay , one battery . Electronics . Advanced chip . Expensive . Yeah it's the most advanced . Chip-on-print . We have that one . Well , it's the most advanced . We have the simple , regular and advanced . Advanced . We have the adva advanced . 'Kay , so uncurved or flat . Nope . Single curved or double curved ? We have double curved . {gap} {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} So {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Then we have plastic , wood , rubber . {vocalsound} {gap} we have half rubber , half plastic . Mm , yes . No titanium . Special colour . Yes , yellow . Uh , yellow . {vocalsound} Yeah . Mm , yeah . Interface , push-button . Scroll-wheel , integrated scroll-wheel push push-button , or L_C_D_ display . {vocalsound} So , we have the L_C_D_ We have two scroll-wheels ? Or one ? One . One . And it's not really a s Joystick uh thing . {gap} . Yeah , it's this one . Now , uh button supplement . {vocalsound} Special colour . We already {disfmarker} Uh , that's the {disfmarker} from the {disfmarker} for the buttons . The buttons are regular colour . Mm , yeah . So , then uh {disfmarker} then then then then then then {disfmarker} Then {disfmarker} {vocalsound} We're not gonna make it . {vocalsound} Uh , no . It's too expensive . Yeah . {vocalsound} Wh So , we have to change something . What what are the costs ? Fifteen Euros . {vocalsound} Fifteen . Yeah , well uh when we lose one scroll-wheel , it's okay . 'Cause we can't lose the battery . We can't lose the advanced chip . We can't lose the double curve . We have rubber , special colour . {gap} . We would have uh n A special colour . Oh , no , we {disfmarker} Uh , I don't think it's a very special colour . No , it's uh {disfmarker} Sorry ? Yellow ? Uh , is it a special colour ? For a remote control . {vocalsound} What ? I've {disfmarker} For a remote control , I think it is . {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} If we would have uh uh normal buttons instead of uh the joystick . For up down left right . Um , then we uh lose two Euros . Then we have thirteen Euros . Half a Euro too much . Exactly the special colours . So {disfmarker} And what if we use only one sort of um {disfmarker} Um {vocalsound} just only plastic or only rubber ? That's one Euro . One Euro discount . {vocalsound} So , I don't think that's good . Mm {disfmarker} I think we have to keep the L_C_D_ . If {disfmarker} If we change the joyst uh the joystick thing into a button up , button down , button right , button left . Yes . Then it's only thirteen Euros . {vocalsound} And then we'll lose fifty cent in what ? So uh {disfmarker} yeah . Yeah . Then you have {disfmarker} Or you have to cut this off . Uh {disfmarker} uh-uh . Then it's not good anymore . No . So , wait . Okay . I'll have a look . {vocalsound} We {disfmarker} And if you say it's just a r uh normal colour {disfmarker} it's a normal colour , wh {vocalsound} Yellow rubber . No one will see it . {vocalsound} Yeah , normal . Normal colour , and the the joystick away , and put the button up , button down , right , left . Uh {disfmarker} And it's twelve Euros , I think . One minute , please . Uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Is it maximum . Um {disfmarker} Yeah , it's normal colour . But if you lose the joystick , it's still uh an advanced chip ? No . Uh , no , no , no . Or it's then a regular ? Uh {disfmarker} Oh , wait wait wait . The advanced chip was for the L_C_D_ wasn't it ? Yeah . Oh yeah . So , the advanced is for the L_C_D_ and the regular for the joystick . Oh yeah . Yeah . Yeah , yeah . And what if we lose the L_C_D_ ? If we lose the L_C_D_ , then we have an uh regular chip and no L_C_D_ . Yeah , regular chip . But {disfmarker} Is it a good design ? Uh , yeah . Then you'll have to m uh see the menu on the television . And you don't have the L_C_D_ . If uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} So , the T_V_s has to uh {disfmarker} have to be up-to-date . If we have the n no buttons {disfmarker} If we have we have uh not a joystick but buttons , we would have {disfmarker} uh , we have thirteen Euros ? Mm , yes . Yeah . And then uh we move the the colour . What will that be ? Yeah . Then it's okay . Huh . No knew that . Yeah . {vocalsound} Okay , so no joystick . Oh no , but we {disfmarker} then we get push-buttons from half a Euro . Yeah , then it's twelve Euro fifty , then it's okay . Uh , yes , yes , yes , yes . No joystick . Push-buttons . No special colour . Twelve and a half Euros . Then it's okay . So , we have to change that a little bit . And you cannot use the red and green button . Because if you give them a s uh colour , Okay . All the same uh {disfmarker} you have to pay point two Euros . So , all the buttons has to {disfmarker} have to be the same colour . Yes . But then the print on it will g um change it . Make it uh for everybody to see what button it is . Uh l How you call it ? Mm , yeah . Recognisable . Like what {disfmarker} Recognisable , yeah . Yes . Yeah . Mm , yeah . So {disfmarker} Yeah ? Okay . Okay . {gap} So {disfmarker} Well {disfmarker} Now we have to change that , but that's okay . Rubber . What's the normal colour ? {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Oh , well that's clear . {vocalsound} So {disfmarker} And {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Where's {gap} ? Yeah . So , now it's {disfmarker} And the joystick away . And its buttons . Yeah . It is . But then it will be just that ones . Yeah . Now it's {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {gap} still , he waited at the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Very good . No . Now , uh project eva evaluation . Well {disfmarker} What do you think of it ? Uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} About the About the project . Project . process . Went good . Uh {disfmarker} I think uh the creativity uh {vocalsound} was good enough . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} We have a gun instead of a remote control . Um {disfmarker} Uh leadership . Yeah , you were the project project manager , and uh had the final vote . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} So {disfmarker} {vocalsound} yeah that was clear . Team-work okay . Everybody uh has something uh to say about it . And uh {disfmarker} no , uh o only the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} the drawing uh was very difficult . But , nah . New ideas found . {vocalsound} Nope . Okay . And you . Yeah , well the same . I I espe I especially uh liked the the means , the the SMARTboard and uh {disfmarker} Yeah , it uh {disfmarker} It brings up new ideas when you work with uh with it . Okay . Yeah . Yeah , I think you have to compare it to if you would have a normal um normal project without laptops uh and without these devices . I think um {disfmarker} Well , the laptops if you have them out front of you , you sometimes looking at that instead of the presentation . Um , well uh the draw-board , well you can draw things . But it not really going very convenient . Mm-hmm . Uh , maybe it will be easier if you have a smaller monitor {gap} and uh you would also see there . And with a normal mouse . Um , and uh the project . Yeah , I agree on what was said uh mainly . Uh , yeah but you always have that some people are talking more than others . And maybe is then um the task of the the project manager to also uh ask more to the people uh less talking . To tell their opinion . Okay . Well , what do I have to say . I think it was good . Not too many discussions . {vocalsound} No . So , it's good for the speed . No . Yep . So , I think we're ready . Yeah . Good price . Evaluation ready . Ready . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Beer . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} That's it . Yeah ? Okay then . Okay . {gap} .",
        "summarize": "Firstly, User Interface introduced the prototype of remote control based on the previous discussion of its function. The prototype was half rubber and half plastic with a yellow case. Secondly, Marketing designed an evaluation test under the guidance of the market trend as well as the customers' taste and the team gave one to seven points to each feature of the product.Thirdly, the team found that the current product exceeded the budget, so the team decided to discard joystick and use only one material with the normal color but the team agreed to keep the LCD as well as the advanced chips. Lastly, the team gave positive feedback on the project and the process."

        "transcript": "Uh , making a profit of fifty million Euros . {vocalsound} Alright so twenty five . Mm 'kay . So , it's go gonna have to be be pretty damn trendy . {vocalsound} So yeah , I've {disfmarker} The only the only remote controls I've used usually come with the television , and they're fairly basic . Yeah . Yeah . Mm-hmm . So uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Yeah , I was thinking that as well , I think the the only ones that I've seen that you buy are the sort of one for all type things where they're , Yeah the universal ones . Yeah . Mm . yeah . So presumably that might be an idea to put into . But but to sell it for twenty five you need a lot of neat features . For sure . Slim . Yeah , yeah . Yeah . Uh 'cause I mean , what {disfmarker} uh twenty five Euros , that's about I dunno , fifteen Pounds or so ? And that's quite a lot for a remote control . Mm-hmm , it's about that . Yeah , yeah . Mm . {vocalsound} Um well my first thoughts would be most remote controls are grey or black . As you said they come with the T_V_ so it's normally just your basic grey black remote control {gap} functions , Uh-huh . so maybe we could think about colour ? Mm-hmm . Make {disfmarker} that might make it a bit different from the rest at least . Um , and as you say , we need to have some kind of gimmick , so um I thought maybe something like if you lose it and you can whistle , Okay . {vocalsound} The the keyrings , yeah yeah . you know those things ? Because we always lose our remote control . Right . {vocalsound} Uh yeah uh , Okay , that's cool . being as a Marketing Exper Expert I will like to say like before deciding the cost of this remote control or any other things we must see the market potential for this product like what is the competition in the market ? What are the available prices of the other remote controls in the prices ? {gap} Okay . What speciality other remote controls are having and how complicated it is to use these remote controls as compared to other remote controls available in the market . So before deciding or before finalising this project , we must discuss all these things , like {disfmarker} Okay . and apart from this , it should be having a good look also , because people really li uh like to play with it when they are watching movies or playing with {gap} or playing with their C_D_ player , M_P_ three player like any electronic devices . Mm . Mm-hmm . They really want to have something good , having a good design in their hands , {gap} Mm-hmm . Yeah . Okay . so , yes , 'Kay . all this . Uh , what do we think a {disfmarker} So , we're looking for {disfmarker} {gap} 'Kay . What do we think a good size would be for this ? {gap} We're {disfmarker} {gap} 'Cause I I know as you add more buttons to the remote it sometimes gets so big and clunky Sorry , carry on . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} and there's just like a hundred buttons on it , Mm-hmm . Yeah . or you could have a really small slim one but then you could lose it easily . {vocalsound} Mm-hmm . Yeah . Then you lose it , yeah . {vocalsound} Okay . Kind of um , maybe more like a P_D_A_ kind of , just hand held , like , For for uh 'cause {disfmarker} remember we're trying to make it for twelve Euros fifty . {vocalsound} Yeah . No , I wasn't , no sorry I wasn't thinking of the screen of like a P_D_A_ Okay well right we'll have to um {disfmarker} I'll {disfmarker} but we're k having another meeting in half an hour so um Okay . we should all look into a bit uh , oh actually , no , we'll allocate . So you do the looking around at other remote controls . Yeah . Um , if you could maybe come up with sort of shapes and suggested shades or whatever , and you could look into um {vocalsound} basically how how it's made I_E_ like how you make it all in one , how {disfmarker} what sort of materials are available to you whatever . And obviously , other instructions will come from the personal coach . Right . Which will probably just usurp what I said so {disfmarker} So you want me to look at shapes and everything you said ? Shapes and colours and {disfmarker} um basically how to make it attractive . Yep . Okay . Uh . Mm-hmm . {gap} And you look at competition and design . Yep . Cool . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Okay . Okay . {gap} So {gap} we have uh {disfmarker} Wait for emails ? Uh . {vocalsound} Um . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Hmm . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Okay , groovy . And no doubt we'll get um {disfmarker} Oh no , {gap} . Sorry . Sorry We'll get um warnings for next meetings as well . it's okay . Okay , cool . {vocalsound} Okay . I shall {disfmarker} I can't imagine these {gap} are worth much . {vocalsound} Hmm . Okay . Fashion into electronic . Okay .",
        "summarize": "The meeting was mainly about the exchange of the preliminary ideas about a new TV remote control project and subsequent task assignment. The project manager first set a target of making a fifty million Euros' profit from the project, with the unit price of twenty-five Euros. Afterwards, the team raised different opinions about features of the new remote controls and related questions about market potential. Among all the features, having a good look and size was unanimously considered to be the most essential. In the end, Marketing was assigned to investigate market competition and design, and User Interface thinking about shapes, colours and other attributes which would attract customers."

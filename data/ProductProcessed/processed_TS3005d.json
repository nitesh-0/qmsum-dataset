        "transcript": "Good . Beep . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Oh . So well uh What ? welcome everyone . Yeah . Um as you may have noticed I uh {vocalsound} {vocalsound} created separate folders because it was uh tending to get a little busy in our uh shared project documents uh folder . Yeah . I don't know if everybody uh put their own uh documents in the right folder , which is for now the detailed design meeting . That's new one ? Yeah . We didn't make any uh {disfmarker} Uh , we should save that one . {vocalsound} Oh in {disfmarker} Then I'll move this one . Didn't we just do that ? Yeah , save in the folder . Save as project . Oh . Oh no , this is just one big document , so you can leave that wherever it is . Oh , okay . {vocalsound} And we have a evaluation left here . {vocalsound} Hmm hmm . Okay . Agenda . Well not main documents this time . Oh uh yes . Hmm ? I have it open myself I guess . Um well the detailed design meeting {disfmarker} Huh ? We're finally getting somewhere hopefully . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Um what are we going to do ? I've opened it already . Um I'm still going to take some minutes , and if I'm right , you two are going to give a prototype presentation ? Oh , sorry . {vocalsound} {gap} Aren't you ? We could . {vocalsound} Yes , you are . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} And uh m did you do something with evaluation criteria ? Yep . Yep . Good . And we have a correct agenda . And uh then we have to look at something which is less nice , the finance uh aspect , whether we can afford what we have designed , Oops . {vocalsound} and if we can we can uh commence the final part which is the production or project evaluation , how did we work together and what are the results , and how happy are we with those . Okay , well finance uh will be later . Now I'd like to give the word to you two . Yeah . Okay . {vocalsound} Well uh Get up stand up . {gap} just {disfmarker} we made a prototype . 'Kay . We first start with the overall uh {disfmarker} This is about the total remote control . View . We made it green . Just example colour , Yeah . so uh there's one of the colours we would like to uh see in our prototype . It's a fresh colour . And uh the screen light blue . Oh uh this the scroll button and the microphone on the on the sides here under . And the R_ and R_ logo , it just says R_ and R_ now , but uh {disfmarker} Okay ? Any questions so far ? {vocalsound} Big microphone . {gap} yeah , Yeah . just uh just an idea about how to m th that could also be possible . Oh okay . That's the place where it's going to be , not the size . {gap} Yeah . Uh well , it's an idea in a {disfmarker} so . Oh y you {disfmarker} perhaps you should make it a bit big , so people know it's there and uh {disfmarker} Do not forget it . Uh {disfmarker} Mm-hmm . To function it it doesn't really have to be sm uh big of course . Hmm . Yeah , okay . Of course . The microphone could be just a minor uh hole uh on the left uh button . Mm . Mm , th yeah . Okay um Small . {vocalsound} we also made some uh ideas about how uh the options menu would work . Uh using the scroll button on sides uh y uh I uh um {gap} {disfmarker} You push the scroll button Yeah , you push the scroll button and it's claps out if there's a {disfmarker} {vocalsound} and a drop down menu or a pull out menu comes out and uh you get uh you get the options uh becoming available . For example uh T_V_ settings , uh remote settings , et cetera . Remote settings , et cetera . Yeah . So uh you can scroll down too with the scroll uh button , uh as you can see {disfmarker} oh , it's here , just push it in , uh the menu comes out like this and uh i it all becomes visible . Um {disfmarker} Yeah . And you could also touch it so that it comes out , Yeah , that's c and and use the the the scroll thing as a {disfmarker} with your fingers . Yeah . Indeed . Yes . Okay , um it's also uh nice to see that um we made a small uh menu , uh the options menu uh becoming available when pressing the uh scroll uh button , and the opportunity to use the teletext , whi which is used uh {disfmarker} which should still be used and we think that it's uh very handy to put it uh not uh under the options menu , but in uh {disfmarker} Yes . In an apart uh {disfmarker} Yeah . So a separate button for for text , In a separate button , yeah . {vocalsound} Yeah . okay . Perhaps we should use the teletext sign in p yeah . A sign , yeah , just like {disfmarker} Okay , indeed . Yeah . Okay , Forgot . {vocalsound} we can uh modify that later . Okay . Would you like to make any comments about next uh {disfmarker} Uh well , this is the total interface uh that f of the L_C_D_ screen . Uh the numbers , which is pretty straight forward . We put ano an an extra button in . We can erase it , but {disfmarker} It's the button where you can switch channels . {gap} just when you are one and you go to two , you can {disfmarker} or if you go to five , you can go back to one with that button . Yeah , that one , yeah . Previous page , yeah , indeed . It has a name . And uh uh we put that in , Oh my God . I thought it would be handy there . Uh this the one number or two numbers button . Below that , the page and the sound . And uh in the middle the the mute . Uh battery indicator . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} It's quite large . It's {vocalsound} it's a bit big . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} And this is the uh the on off uh knop , the stand by uh knop . Or at least it should look like it . And the options uh of teletext . Okay . You can see very clearly now that the uh teletext and options menu isn't uh taking uh much uh {disfmarker} uh it's taking much part of the screen , so it's very uh {disfmarker} when you uh {vocalsound} when you use it , doesn't uh become irritating to see . Huh . 'Cause if you put it on the top you always get see the the options menu . 'Cause people regularly uh read from left top to right down , Mm-hmm . so {disfmarker} Yeah . Well this about it , I think . Okay . Huh . Yeah . Thank you . Looks good . I will put it back on the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} on the nice green . {vocalsound} And I just missed when I was typing {disfmarker} The R_R_ stands for ? {gap} That's the logo of the {disfmarker} Logo , okay . {vocalsound} Yeah . It's th th right now it's only R_ R_ , but uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Okay well {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Full screen . I would have recognised it if it were the right colours of course . {vocalsound} Shit . Yeah . {vocalsound} Alright . {vocalsound} Sorry . {vocalsound} 'Kay . {gap} Okay , the evaluation criteria , Oh full screen , yeah {vocalsound} {gap} . Huh . huh ? Evaluation . 'Kay , my task was this time to put up a questionnaire by which we can evaluate the design of the remote control by the questions we {gap} {disfmarker} requirements from the {disfmarker} of the users . My name , my job , okay . My name , my job . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} The methods . Questionnaire with seven point scale from one to seven , from true to false , Right . like question , is remote big enough , we can say it's true or it's false by steps . One means absolutely not true , seven {gap} {disfmarker} means true . Yeah . The three important things of refa {vocalsound} {gap} are uh from th of this year is {disfmarker} are , {vocalsound} Sorry , {vocalsound} {vocalsound} you used the PowerPoint {gap} {disfmarker} is the remote control fancy enough , Yeah . is it in innovative enough , and is it easy enough to use . And then evaluation itself . Uh . {vocalsound} What ? {vocalsound} So . Bling . Okay . Yeah . First question . Is the design fancy enough ? Well {disfmarker} Project Manager , what do you think ? Well it's {disfmarker} looks fancy , especially with the green colour . And the the curves which we decided , {vocalsound} Yeah . But does it {disfmarker} huh ? Yeah . Only what happened to the single curve we spoke about last meeting ? It uh {disfmarker} oh it's in the background . Oh . {vocalsound} Now uh the single curved idea was uh {disfmarker} Yeah , okay , you ge um {disfmarker} Y you should make uh a sideways uh view . Yeah . The sideways view , uh that that that ma It will be , I guess . Oh , we can {disfmarker} Ho not that pen . {vocalsound} Not that pen . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Oh {vocalsound} {gap} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Well g {vocalsound} I would {vocalsound} {disfmarker} smart board . it might work one time , huh . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Suppose so . {vocalsound} Uh can I draw here or uh {disfmarker} Think . Ooh . Ah . Oh my God , Yeah , yeah , you can . So it would be uh something like this from the side , but with a bit of uh curve here , it works . right ? Yeah , that's the single curve indeed . Yeah . So if you v flip it like this . Okay . Yep . Here's {gap} yeah . That's not very {disfmarker} i it's also uh very handy if you make a side curve way to make the the remote control very thin at the bottom uh at a bottom at a bottom . Uh make it uh rather thick on the top , because uh on the top it has uh the screen , which takes uh in some uh space , and the batteries can be located over there , Yeah . So you just make the back of this part a bit bigger , so uh {disfmarker} so that it lays a bit o Yeah . Isn't going to be a little bit heavy at the top ? {gap} {vocalsound} Yeah , that's a bit of problem maybe . {vocalsound} No . With two batteries , the whole print plate and t and top , and if you're holding it quite a lot I think {disfmarker} Yeah . I think yeah , the battery should be in here , because it's just nothing , Yeah . so if you could {disfmarker} Yeah . Okay , indeed . Yeah . Yeah . Okay , but we have to rate uh these things now ? 'Cause otherwise I think i Yeah , we have to rate . Okay . Is it fancy enough ? True is one , false is seven . So fancy enough means , does it comes to the younger people and the elder people . I think it does . I think so . I if you don't make it green , then the elder people won't won't like it . It's pretty fancy . I think {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Yeah , I have to agree , all the colour colours don don doesn't matter that m that much now , Yeah . {gap} you get th Mm-hmm . it's only design . I think it does . Yeah . And the design . Well I think uh especially because of the microphone and the L_C_D_ screen also . Yeah . Yeah . I don't know whether older people will use it , but {disfmarker} Very new thing . Well {disfmarker} Fancy {gap} the old people will . So {disfmarker} I would make it a two or something . {gap} A two ? Yeah . {gap} It's true , it's a one . {vocalsound} Very fancy . Huh ? Alright , it's a one . {vocalsound} Oh it's a one . {vocalsound} No , it's a two . {vocalsound} Little bit strange we have to judge that ourselves , huh ? Yeah . Yeah , I n used {disfmarker} I wouldn I should use that one , but it doesn't {disfmarker} {vocalsound} But it's a one uh {disfmarker} Maybe uh {disfmarker} Okay , no it's two ? True is a one . Yeah . Very true , is it very true or isn't that true ? Well I'd say two on a scale {disfmarker} Well they think it's very true , but uh {disfmarker} It's very true , because we designed it to be very fancy , Yeah , I think two . {vocalsound} Yeah , so {disfmarker} but {disfmarker} It's very fancy , I think . We should perhaps {disfmarker} Have you ever seen a remote control like this ? No , okay well , that's true . {vocalsound} No , okay , That not . so so it's fancy . That's fancy enough . Yeah . Okay , one two . Then ? That doesn't matter that much , so make it a one . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} Okay . Let's give it a two . Is it innovative ? I think it is , Enough . Yeah because it has an L_C_D_ screen , a mi microphone . m And uh uh the scroll is rubber , It's from rubber . We have for the search function . Yeah . {vocalsound} so s Eno enough to {gap} I think . The scroller a bit {disfmarker} I think it's it's a one yeah . {vocalsound} It's a one I think . {gap} True . Also huh uh-huh {disfmarker} the buttons , are they easy to find ? That was a big requirement of the old people . {vocalsound} Yeah , because they're right on your screen . So you can use the b the the arrows . They're right on your screen , Huh . so I don't know where you'd search . With the ones {gap} Are all the buttons easy to find ? Not only this buttons , all the buttons . Yeah . {vocalsound} Well , I think they are . The options are it {disfmarker} uh little bit harder , Yeah . but if you touch the options then it's uh {disfmarker} Take a harder look , yeah , sure . I think th it's It's easier than the regular uh remote control . easy t Yeah , and you use these buttons the most , Yeah , I think this is easy now . I think th I think the options buttons are not the the easiest way to to huh ? So {disfmarker} Yeah . No they're not , but they're they're they are easy to find . to handle . True . Yeah , they are a lot easier to find than uh th than on the regular remote controls I would rate it a {disfmarker} Oh . where you have to uh find out what {disfmarker} which sign or icon means on uh every button . Yeah , okay , that's true , that's true . Yeah . So So you have t you have to use the the the manual to understand most {disfmarker} which {disfmarker} But that's that's vantage of L_C_D_ screen , you can have text . So which number are we going to fill in ? Yeah . I would say yeah . I think it's uh it's a two , at least . Yeah . Yeah , A two , yeah ? you can make it a two . Two , three and {disfmarker} It's not perfect , but {disfmarker} Yeah . what do you think ? {vocalsound} I think it's a three . A three ? Okay , so we have two , two , three . And why is that ? I personally think , because I d I don't think i maybe it's easy to use , it has to be easy to find right away . I I think if you have the button at the right , I don't think you can find the option button that easy . Yeah , but you don't have t have to use the button on the right . You can touch it . You can touch it . Yeah . You you can touch options . It said bo both the options . Yeah , okay , but you have y then you have here s written option on here , the teletext button , Yeah . right ? Yeah . Okay , then okay , good . Then I think also two , yeah . You can touch options A two , okay , and it's comes out . because we have to {disfmarker} A two , a two . Yep . {vocalsound} The uh the um {disfmarker} Below . It's the box below it , Uh the next question the next question . huh ? Oh my God . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Otherwise we have two results in one question . {vocalsound} It's different . {vocalsound} Okay , next question . It's easy to use , as well for younger as elderl elderly people . For young people I think it's easy to use . {gap} Young means sixteen to forty years . Yeah , I was {disfmarker} uh {disfmarker} Yeah . And elderly from forty eight to their death . Yeah . I think it's {disfmarker} I think it's the most useful uh remote control ever to be manufactured . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} In the entire mankind . Okay , you're very enthusiastic about your own design , Also if you're sixty years old {disfmarker} huh ? Yeah , but because it has the regular uh controls , li uh as you can see in the screen now , and uh you don't have all the other options uh always uh on your screen . Yeah . So it's t I think it's really easy to use . You want these options to {disfmarker} Also As well for the for the older people ? Uh sure . Yeah , as well as your {disfmarker} if you're fif sixty years old , you're holding one of those things in your hand {disfmarker} Yeah , but uh {disfmarker} Yeah , but they they don't want the uh extra options , right ? No , but we're going to th make this f for a all kind of people , So {disfmarker} And would it be easy for them to use the speech recognition ? Yeah , okay , so it it it has to be {disfmarker} but so they could {disfmarker} Uh I think it is . If they read a manual . Because that might {disfmarker} {vocalsound} If you read the manual , {vocalsound} Yeah , alright . {vocalsound} Perhaps that is one of the most uh {disfmarker} {gap} always . M maybe that's the most user friendly and easy to use . Because it it's not it's not it's it's not uh difficult . Uh because a lot of {vocalsound} {disfmarker} You say you say uh record to to the to the speech recognition , Channel one , channel four , yeah . then you say the question and the answer . And that's everything it does , the speech recognition . {vocalsound} Yeah , well maybe that would make it even more easy to use for them . Yeah . I think it would make it uh {disfmarker} Yeah , I think it does . So {disfmarker} Because all the people who can't uh {disfmarker} I would make it two . Also two ? Yeah . Uh a two . Sure , two . Not a seven for this {gap} ? {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Three ? Oh . I'd say three . I would also say three . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Okay , so we have three three two two Oh . You ? or {disfmarker} Two . Oh . So what are we going to do ? {vocalsound} Well {disfmarker} Two and a half . {vocalsound} Okay , a three , I see . Uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Three ? No . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Give me more . {vocalsound} Another question . Remotes overwhelmed with buttons . No . No . No . No , that that's that's {disfmarker} But um I mean , yeah . that's definitely one . Tha that's a one , I think , that's definitely a one . That's definitely our uh {disfmarker} Oh nee , oh seven is it ? It is . No ? Yeah , uh Oh yeah . Yeah . Yeah , the remote score . A false , yeah . but I think you should make it one scale with with one being good and seven being bad , Yeah , I think isn't , this has to be something like isn't overwhelmed . because otherwise we can't uh calculate anything from the results , It's not overwhelmed . Yeah . so {disfmarker} Yeah , indeed . True . Okay , a one , Yep . because we designed for that , huh ? Remote control has uh colours that different {disfmarker} that meet different target groups . Yes . {vocalsound} {gap} 'Cause we make them in different colours , Yeah . so that they uh {disfmarker} Yeah , Yeah . is optional . Yeah , and I though w we had about single colours , That's true . but you can also make uh a wood colour , not just one single colour but a wood-like thing , Yeah . That it that it looks like wood , like something , yeah . Huh . can't you ? Also with rubber ? Uh I think you can . Whether it looks like wood , it isn't w it isn't wood Yeah , okay . but {disfmarker} It it feels like rubber , You can make a print on rubber , but {disfmarker} {vocalsound} can't you ? Yeah . Yeah . So that's a one then , Well but then when you scratch it it does come off . Yeah ? huh ? {vocalsound} That's a one ? So that's a bit {disfmarker} Yeah , it is it is harder to Okay . Do you have many questions ? Uh I have {disfmarker} to like {disfmarker} Oh , okay well {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Oh we have time . {vocalsound} Geez . Yeah , but we have {disfmarker} We also {disfmarker} We have to get to the money . {vocalsound} We're getting paid . We're getting paid . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} The material used is spongy , {vocalsound} What ? that that's uh that's a one , that's m rubber . What {gap} spongy . Yeah , yeah , it's very spongy . Uh . Yeah , Oh I th think it's not the most spongy thing . but not {disfmarker} it's not very spongy , because it's hard rubber . I think it's a three . Yeah , it's a three , Uh-huh , yeah . Yeah . because you want to make it uh rather flexible but not too flexible , Hard but {disfmarker} Yeah . You can {vocalsound} break it . because it has a L_C_D_ screen . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} Hard to lose , Remote control is hard to lose . yeah it sh and it's easy to find . Y yeah , you could you could call it . Y you can't you can't lose it if you're sixty years old . If first time see the thing you didn didn't adjust uh {disfmarker} set the microphone , and then you lose it , then you have lost it . Yeah , y you can lose it , but it isn't hard to lose . It isn't hard , no . I think I think this is a two , personally . Two . That it's hard to lose ? No . Yeah , it it is {disfmarker} there's the {disfmarker} Yeah , Isn't hard to lose . so isn't hard to lose you . {vocalsound} it's a six , you think ? {vocalsound} Isn't hard to lose , yeah . {vocalsound} Isn't hard to lose . So it's a two . Yeah , you can lose it , so I don't {gap} {disfmarker} Yeah . You can't lose it . you can make it a three I {gap} {disfmarker} It does have an {disfmarker} a built in function . Or if you're you're sixty years old , your demands {disfmarker} Yeah , but a har A hard to lose is good . So it should {disfmarker} this question should be hard to lose . It's difficult to lose it . Nee . Hard to lose . Oh right . Yeah , this this is hard to lose . {vocalsound} It is hard to lose . Yeah , so then this is {disfmarker} it is almost true , This {vocalsound} {disfmarker} A two . I think {disfmarker} yeah , I think also . so a two . A two . Two , yeah . Okay . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {gap} {vocalsound} And most all because of the option to {disfmarker} Whoa . Huh ? Ooh . {vocalsound} Yeah , it's okay . That happens above also . But maybe when you scroll away and back it will be normal , Oh . Uh . Yeah ? Oh , okay . but {disfmarker} Yep . Oh , No . it isn't , Oh well , well okay . {vocalsound} it doesn't . {gap} put the cor cursor {gap} on the {gap} . Remember . {vocalsound} Okay okay okay . Click . Remote control mainly be sold to younger people . I think it will , True . yeah . True . {vocalsound} Yeah ? True ? Very true ? Uh well Uh yeah . Uh {disfmarker} There . I {disfmarker} a No , I don't think very true because the colours . a two . {vocalsound} We have the colours . Um we have the buttons is {disfmarker} aren't that that much . Materials , yeah . Nah , the material isn't that {disfmarker} It's it's much more younger . Uh okay . So ma uh make it make it a two . So I don I think I think it's a three . Well I think it's it's uh a lower number , so better because w we designed it for young people especially , Yeah . Yeah , didn't we ? I think it's a two but I uh {disfmarker} but {disfmarker} Okay , okay . What do you think ? I think because {disfmarker} Questions ? A two ? I think it's two . I think it's two too , two too too . Two . Uh-huh . {vocalsound} yeah ? Two two two . {vocalsound} Let's make everything a two . In the features ? Dissatisfy younger people . Um {disfmarker} Younger people . It has {disfmarker} Well perhaps not . What did {disfmarker} Because younger peoples are cr critical and they wanted a lot of features on this thing . Yeah . Well that {disfmarker} it doesn't . Well , n not exactly but uh uh if it had some games on it or something like that , {vocalsound} Yeah bu but {disfmarker} {vocalsound} but it's for a remote control I think it i {vocalsound} it would satisfy those needs . I think they like the speech . You could call to your uh {disfmarker} Yeah , the speech possibility , yeah , and the screen , the colours . L_C_D_ screen and scroll . yeah . Scroll options , yeah . I I think they'll be quite met with their expectations . Yeah , but those are more fancy functions , not not really many features or something . Right , that that that {disfmarker} No . It has relatively few features , those are features . It's three features , basically , with {disfmarker} the L_C_D_ {gap} touch screen is feature . Yeah . No , The microphone is a feature . aren't the features {disfmarker} the microphone's feature and that you can change the channel's feature , and that you can change the volume is feature , Yeah . and that you can change the options of the remote , uh uh something like that . Yeah . Ours had other features with {disfmarker} Yeah , okay . I think {disfmarker} yeah , and then you have the audio settings , channel setting , video settings . The easy volume up button . Those are features . Remote {disfmarker} younger people usually use the remote control to put on the volume . {vocalsound} Turn uh turn up the volume . {vocalsound} Yeah yeah . {vocalsound} Enough features ? So I've chos I shou I think it's it's it's a one . Personally , yeah . I think once you've {disfmarker} 'cause you have the channel features b uh you have the uh screen features , audio features , the {disfmarker} you have all buttons on it which you'd like , microphone extra , L_C_D_ screen extra , scroll thing extra . Okay , you think one , Yeah . what do you think ? I think two or three . You . {gap} three , yeah . Two . I'd say three , so two it is then Yeah . Yeah uh a two a two . {vocalsound} Just another two . {vocalsound} Make it make it a two . or {disfmarker} {vocalsound} One two three . {vocalsound} Or make it uh a fucking two . We like two . {vocalsound} Right . You can see the remote control is {gap} R_ and R_ . Yeah , there's R_ and R_ in front . Yeah . Uh . Yep . {gap} Has {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Uh it's not the colour , so maybe you should make two , but it has R_ and R_ . oh yeah , do did have {disfmarker} nah y you have the black one . Yeah . And we'll probably make also a yellow one . Yeah . Yeah , Yeah , but not R_ and R_ yellow I think . maybe maybe two . Well m th but the logo is on on the front , Okay , true , yeah . Maybe two . so {disfmarker} a two , yeah , One d on i it's the colours and the {disfmarker} X_ marks spot . {vocalsound} that's {disfmarker} And the menu is avail that is available is easy to use . {vocalsound} I think it is , but I don't know what you think . {vocalsound} I think it's easier to use than a regular remote control , because when you push on the options menu , you get the the the various options uh entirely explained . Entirely explained . Yeah , tha that's so true . Mm-hmm . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Instead of uh just finding out what an icon means on a button . Mm-hmm . Yeah , uh {disfmarker} And you can navigate easier , because wi with the {disfmarker} you have to push the the the arrows and {disfmarker} with a normal T_V_ uh remote . Yeah , you can navigate . Uh . I think that wou that would be quite hard to learn to use it . You're not satisfied , okay . Let's start over again then . {vocalsound} No , I'm not not convinc . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} Let's make a different remote . Well {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Let's go th for {vocalsound} inhalation of air] Menu . {vocalsound} I think it would be a t yeah , two . A two ? {vocalsound} {vocalsound} A two . Now lower . {vocalsound} Oh , well that's that's pretty good , We only have twos . {vocalsound} huh ? Oh yeah , I think so . Yeah . Uh just twos . One three and a few ones . And three . So okay , we have one three , a one , that that have to got up . {gap} Two threes . Two two two two two . We m mostly have twos , so it's pretty good . So two , yeah . The average is a two . Yeah . The average . {vocalsound} That is quite good Yeah . I think so too . Yeah , I think so . in my opinion . That {gap} We can be happy . Ooh . Save . {vocalsound} {gap} {vocalsound} Yeah . Ooh . What is it ? It's like a bug or something . It's a fly . A fly , yeah . Oh m A f butterfly . Top . Yeah . That's it . Okay . That was your evaluation uh show , Yes . okay , so we don't have to calculate anything because of um these results . {vocalsound} Sure . No , it's two . The average is two . Okay , good . It's good . Yeah . Um let's see {disfmarker} oh , it isn't asked to save but it did already {gap} Yeah . Exactly . Yeah , I uh uh I uh saved it . And this {gap} Everything okay . Well , the next part uh might be a little bit difficult to do in a group , but I am willing to try it . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Because we are going to look at the finance and I have a nice Excel sheet to do that . Yeah . {vocalsound} Redesign . No . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} And um I'm not sure if I put it in the project folder . {gap} {vocalsound} {gap} look on that . Um and we're going to calculate the production costs , and if they are uh under or at twelve Euro fifty , Yeah . we're good , and if they're not we're going to uh re-design , Yeah . but we have to do that uh very very quick I think , So we're going to erase features or something . yes . Um I don't know if I Do you have the cost put the Excel sheet in the or uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Let's hope . n not in the {vocalsound} {gap} f fifty five Euros . folder . I think it's {vocalsound} We're going to be here at eight o'clock . {vocalsound} I think it's still in my own documents folder . {vocalsound} We're goin still going to be here at eight o'clock . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} No . Oh shit . I doubt it . Perhaps we've got features that don't exist in the Excel sheet . Yeah mm yeah , maybe . So {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} No , The microphone . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah . it was in my uh my information , so uh {disfmarker} It i It wasn't too much . Yeah ? {gap} Yeah . maybe you're going scrap scrap it . As well as the L_C_D_ screen . Whoa . {vocalsound} Okay , well this is it . Well , if it doesn't work {disfmarker} Um maybe I could ask one of you to uh fill it in , so that I can also uh take minutes , I want to fill it in , but uh {disfmarker} and uh maybe the other can uh use that thing to count uh numerous functions . No prob . Ah . But you should uh direct {disfmarker} Count it ? Li like write it be Well we have to count some things and we have to think about some things . But you have to fill in this column , huh ? Count it . You got Excel to count . {vocalsound} The number of {disfmarker} {gap} No , uh count uh number of functions , because for every button you have to pay {disfmarker} Oh okay . and there are different screen shots , so {disfmarker} or different different screens , Well I dra Ah , okay , cool . uh Danny , Danny , I'll do that , Huh ? Yeah ? Oh , yea yeah , you design it . Um {disfmarker} because I draw the uh so {disfmarker} We've got a battery , one or t two batteries , or not ? nee one battery , with two small batteries . {vocalsound} Yeah . Yeah , but it's it's more about the energy source , huh ? Do you use a hand dynamo , a battery , kinetic or solar cells ? Yeah . I would do a battery {disfmarker} we do . Right ? Solar cell . No We'll wait . A battery . One battery , No , no solar cell , no no no no . it took a battery ? right ? Yeah . No hand dynamo . Yeah . {vocalsound} Electronics , simple chip {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Hand {disfmarker} {vocalsound} We have {disfmarker} advanced chip , right ? No , we have sample speaker . On advanced chip . But b al but we also have sample speaker , do Yeah , Yeah , yeah . so this one and this one . Uh we ha we have um single {disfmarker} Oh , we already on nine . what ? Are we ? Oh yay . We have double curved . {vocalsound} The single . Single nee single curved . Double curved was uh uh see uh ju three dimensional . Single . But it isn't three dimensional , Oh the the {disfmarker} it isn't curved in a l This one is {disfmarker} {vocalsound} it's not going to work uh people . We have rubber . This one is curved like this , I'll just fill it in . right . It's curved like this . No no no , Um rubber indeed ? single curved is like this . Uh that's the only curve you made , Yeah , bu what {disfmarker} not th uh curved like that . That's uh {disfmarker} Oh , but we have curves like it and it . Thirteen ? There are two curves , right ? Oh , okay I understand , I understand . With a scroll wheel , Huh ? right ? Is he integrated ? Yeah . Rubber . No , eh ? I don't know . Yeah , Push button . No , we don't have push button . we gotta integrate scroll wheel and push button , because when you push it and you w it won't just pu uh makes possible to s Oh yeah , right , we want it to {disfmarker} it's not it's not {disfmarker} no . {vocalsound} Not going to work ? L_C_D_ display . Yep . Okay . Okay um {disfmarker} Fifteen , oh , too bad . {vocalsound} Oh but with special colour we have . A special form , right ? But now button supplements . We don't got the button supplements . Oh , we don't have any buttons , so {disfmarker} Eighteen and a half , Yeah , we need to uh damn . Damn . We have to lower it with six points . No , uh we have fifteen and {disfmarker} Okay . Twelve and half . oh , right . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} We could lose the curve . Nah . We could use {disfmarker} Yeah , I would lose the curve . We could lose the scroll wheel . You could make it just a regular scroll wheel . But you can't push it , so you have to tap . Yeah , if you can't push it you have to tap the the options window uh button here and then uh scroll down with the d with uh {vocalsound} with uh the button . Yeah , alright . Yeah , I think that will be our best bet . So normal scroll wheel ? Normal scroll wheel . And I think we should lose the curve . I think we should scrap the sample speaker . Lose {vocalsound} {disfmarker} It's four pri it four units . Yeah , but if you {disfmarker} would i it is a new feature , it it's something special . Okay , so we don't exactly need the single {disfmarker} We don't need a curve . But w d wha No , the curve doesn't really {disfmarker} 'S possible to lose curve . Curved then it will be square . No , then it will {disfmarker} won't uh stand up from the table . Then it would just {disfmarker} Okay . {vocalsound} Was that {disfmarker} does that mean to it , single curve ? Yeah , that's meant with scr uh with s curve . Yeah . The curve is uh in a dimension . Okay . If you make it a flat one , s n it's no curve , you got no curves . So {disfmarker} We would lose this one ? Yeah , okay . Yeah , but tha that that only is one . Yeah , we could s yeah , a bit . No , two . No , one . Sixteen point three . Oh , okay , indeed . So we don't {disfmarker} So we still {disfmarker} Yeah , we also have to {disfmarker} Is it possible to make {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Could could we do it on a regular chip on print or something ? No , otherwise we don't have an L_C_D_ screen . No ? Ma y you just can't do that , or uh {disfmarker} No . And what did you change ? You changed the uh scroll wheel We changed th and {disfmarker} Yeah , and the single curved to uncurved . Single curved . Oh , but it's just one Flat . Yeah , so that does doesn't doesn't that mu I think {disfmarker} point , so maybe you should should uh {disfmarker} No . Scrap sample speaker ? Yeah , you should you should drop the speech recognition . The sample speaker is two d wait , f s four points . That that's uh {disfmarker} Yeah , but it's t Yes , four points . And then you can keep the curve . Yeah , but it is uh it it is a new feature , Or can't you ? it is something special . Yeah , uh becau uh when you lose the {disfmarker} Yeah , but what what else what else uh do you want to scrap ? I don't know . {vocalsound} F You have to {disfmarker} we have to scrap four points . Yeah , that's difficult . {vocalsound} Yeah . Or make it on a hand dynamo , but {vocalsound} I don't think that will work . {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Ma make it with wood instead of rubber ? No , that's {disfmarker} no . Uh . Make it w uh when you made it uh uh uh a remote control of wood ? {vocalsound} We could make it titanium instead of rubber . {vocalsound} You don't make a remote control of {disfmarker} Ah . Yeah , Yeah , it it i mm-hmm . Yeah , it also {disfmarker} uh it also takes one point less . Yeah , but uh a wooden remote control only helps for uh old people we discussed , Oh . Oh can I ask something ? yes ? What is special colour ? Yeah . Is that the wood uh wood uh {disfmarker} I think it is . this , we have to have that one too ? It isn't . Yeah , What ? Yeah . but it's only a half . But I think the only option is to drop the uh sample speaker . Yeah . Sample speaker . To knock the sample speaker , yeah . And sample sensor . Th then we still have too much Yeah , okay , if we use the uh {disfmarker} But m yeah , course , three . Point three . but {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Yeah , we we scrap that one ? What we'll have . {vocalsound} Huh ? Let's make it thirteen or fourteen . {vocalsound} See , a po Point twelve {gap} . three . {vocalsound} We need point three . {vocalsound} That's a scroll wheel . {vocalsound} Uh it's a colour . Don't make it wood . A colour . Yeah , but a wood {disfmarker} Make it uh {disfmarker} we can make it brown , dark brown , not wood . Yeah , but it's it's special colour , is it a all kind of colours ? Yeah , special colours , fruity colours . It's also green or uh {disfmarker} Is it also {disfmarker} Yeah . no that that's just normal colour {disfmarker} fruit colours . Yeah , but it's a special colour than just rubber colour . Normal colours , yellow {disfmarker} You have to add something to the rubber to make it green . Yeah . You don't say here's green rubber . They don't sell green rubber plants . {vocalsound} Yeah , but then I d I don't think we can ever make to a twelve and half . Alright . Yeah , you can , you should {disfmarker} you have to lose {disfmarker} But then we have to scrap L_C_D_ display , we have to scrap uh No , it is the scroll wheel , I guess . No no no . s advanced chip . No then we have to scrap everything we got because how many colours we gonna make ? If we lose the scroll wheel and make it totally uh depending uh dependent on uh the touch screen Five ? Then we have two . A push , S yeah . touch . {vocalsound} then it's possible to make . And then you can {vocalsound} and then you can add to the colours . Then we can make {disfmarker} add two colours on it . Yeah , two colours {gap} it . Special c Switch colours . Okay , if you lose uh {vocalsound} if you lose the {disfmarker} It was such a great idea . {vocalsound} You lose this one , you got eleven point five They can add two colours . and you make i and then you can make uh the spec single curve , for example . But the colours . Um how ma uh the colours like l she told , is that all the colours we add or {disfmarker} How d uh uh how many colours ? What do you mean ? Special colours , all the colours you want , because you want to make p Yeah , but we we we are {disfmarker} we have yellow , red , uh black , titanium . Yeah , but uh when you use more than one colour , it's a special colour . Oh . Ah okay . But I think when you use the colour that's not originally the rubber then you use special colour , I suppose . 'cause you have to add it . Yeah . Yeah , but the rubbers alls original black . Yeah , so you always lose the special colour . You co you could make it always black , like normal remote . Yeah b Yeah , but we're gonna make it yellow {disfmarker} uh red , and then you add {disfmarker} you have two special colours on top of the one we have now . Nee we we also want to make ano another colour . Oh right , yeah . Yeah , we should u Yeah , but m Yeah . We have to make this like four or five or something . Yeah , That's what it means . because we have more colours than only black . Yeah , but isn't it per remote that you pay ? Yeah . I {disfmarker} then I think I p I don I don't think they me mean they're special {disfmarker} Half ? Oh right , yeah . Is it per remote ? I think you pay half per remote . Yeah . Yeah , that's right , So each remote with a special colour . and you {disfmarker} one colour per remote . Yeah , indeed , yeah . So then it is one . You don't need four of those {vocalsound} uh four of those special colours in one in one remote . Yeah , okay okay , true . True , true . No . I hope . {vocalsound} We have two points spare . So the battery , Nee one point . we have um advanced chip on print . One . So it would be curved , single curve . {vocalsound} Because of {disfmarker} thing {disfmarker} Or not ? Yeah , well you can at least make it curved again . Hmm . So y you just can't make a nice remote . {vocalsound} Yeah , single curve . Because that was very important , It's too bad for the speaker . huh ? So it's curved , it's still that {disfmarker} so we we dropped the speech recognition together with the speaker . Should we change that tha that that's a one if not , Mm yep . We dropped the scroll wheel . or not ? Could you copy it ? And the rest is the same , And make it uh {disfmarker} huh ? Am I right ? Y yea the scroll wheel is dropped . Yes . The entire uh {disfmarker} Uh . Huh . Yep . Perhaps you can then copy page or so . Ooh . No . Oh you you made the entire {disfmarker} could you {disfmarker} Okay . Undo , undo . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Oh Undo . not {disfmarker} Well {gap} . So , 'kay . Would you ? Twenty minutes ? By the {disfmarker} Perhaps you can save this one , and then copy or something . Add it copy page . Select all . No , but you c yeah . Alright , something went wrong . Tap . Okay , but this this new remote we can afford . {vocalsound} It doesn't work . Let's forget . It should've work . Okay , so you had this list at start ? {vocalsound} Hmm ? No , I hadn't . Alright . When did you receive this list ? I just received it . Ah okay . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} Oh They don't work so hard at the finance department . {vocalsound} ignore that . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Well , so {disfmarker} Ah okay . I suppose this is a {disfmarker} Too bad . Okay , so we lose the scroll wheel , Yeah . The microphone . the s Yeah , and that's it . Yeah . And the microphone . A and we changed something , I guess , or not ? We {disfmarker} Oh no . Yep . Okay . Twelve Euro fifty . Um and did you try to make a new design , or what were you trying to do ? Yeah , I tried to copy that one , but it didn't work . It didn't work . So we could fix it like tha that it's like this . {vocalsound} Hmm . Strange . You could select it all , but then you can't erase . {vocalsound} Strange . Oh , you can arrange {disfmarker} You can only re erase ? Erase . Oh . When you saw th li uh {disfmarker} Earlier when we selected it , w I couldn't erase anything . Uh , no . Hmm , can't you then just say copy ? Bling . New page . Paste . Yes . Ah . {vocalsound} Select none . {vocalsound} Just tap somewhere . {gap} just up somewhere b uh besides it , {gap} just tap somewhere . right . Okay , Yeah . and now you can erase . I don't think I can , but uh we can try . Uh , we already try . Well it should be possible . Oh , yeah , Oh no . no , ha-ha . Well you can draw over it with white uh pen . {vocalsound} No ? Yeah , we tried it earlier . Oh . It's very much work . {vocalsound} Yeah . Sorry . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Well but that's also useful for the evaluation , because I think uh we have a prototype now Evaluation drops . which we can afford and uh we only need to draw a little bit to get a good uh design . Doodle . And I think we should then move on to the production evaluation because of the time . And erase the mic . Yeah , goodbye mic . All I need is no mic . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Let's see , we can save this now . Oh , I already erased half of the line . {vocalsound} Bon chance {vocalsound} And move back to here . Too bad , oh . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Like this ? Mm-hmm . Still looks nice . And then all green . Okay , well thank you . Oh , that's erase . Looks like a iPod . Oh , no {gap} . No , Hey , but you can erase that . add {gap} {disfmarker} Yeah , that's a bit weird . Yeah . Uh-oh . Oh , now I'm {gap} line . S Difference between lines and text and the pen . Yeah . Right . {vocalsound} Oh . All I need is {gap} mic . {vocalsound} And you can't erase this ? {vocalsound} Hmm , strange . No , Okay , well uh it's weird . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} just leave it at this and quickly save . Station page . Um and then we are going to the project or product evaluation . Huh , looks fucking boring now . {vocalsound} We just did {gap} our project evaluation . Um well , I think I can sit for that since it's almost my final slide . Um what did you think about uh the process ? How satisfied are we ? Deadlines were sometimes very short . Yeah . Mm-hmm . Bu but stressful . You think , no , my presentation isn't ready . But {disfmarker} Yeah . And stressful . I think we {disfmarker} it should be b it would be better if we worked a little bit together . Yeah . Yeah . Now we worked through each other , And you could ask things . Yeah , you had information I didn't have something he said {disfmarker} and then uh {disfmarker} yeah , and you had information I also had , Oh right . {vocalsound} Yeah . so some some things I had in my presentation , they already told , Yeah . And for me it sometimes was a surprise who was going to present what , huh ? Yeah . so {disfmarker} And uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Yeah . So yeah , that {disfmarker} I don't think that is the best way to work at {disfmarker} for such project . Yeah . No . So you would say uh communicate during our individual uh work . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah , no , or maybe session of five minutes together or something , and then work separate . Yeah , Yeah . but but why not work here together , for example ? Yeah , you could {disfmarker} Why should we be separated from each other in those difference {disfmarker} uh different rooms ? Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Mm-hmm . Well , probably to simulate the whole working uh process , I think so too . Yeah , but then you can work together too Yeah . huh , th {gap} you can't have a meeting uh for several weeks . when {disfmarker} Yeah m yeah , like she told . Then you can work together too by mail or by , I dunno , chat , something , No . A chat would also be uh {disfmarker} Huh , oh right . but now we're completely separated from each other . I don't think that was the best way , but {disfmarker} But the technology was uh fantastic . {gap} Well , Yeah , the technology's okay . I I don't really like the board , it doesn't really work great . Sometimes I think {vocalsound} . Work now ? Yeah okay , but I don I do I think becau that's because {disfmarker} Perhaps it is e It does work , but sometimes it doesn't erase or it doesn't uh {disfmarker} Yeah , perhaps it is easier to get one of those uh dig digital pens or so and to uh {disfmarker} and lay it next to that keyboard over there . Yeah . Yeah . So you can draw uh {disfmarker} see it over th on the screen . Yeah , like the f like a plotters or something , Yeah . Yeah . yeah . Yep yep yep yep yep . So you don't think the SMARTboard is is really useful But {disfmarker} or {disfmarker} Well {vocalsound} It's useful , but not m it is useful , Yeah , it is useful , but {disfmarker} but it doesn't really work all the time . No . Th the pen doesn't {disfmarker} Because when you put this pen on the screen uh uh for exam and line is d being drawn at at two or three centimetres uh below . The line is a bit off . Yeah , so it's maybe a bit unnatural also . Yeah , Alright . Yep . you can point to where you want the line to be . But {disfmarker} The project uh {disfmarker} because of the deadlines you didn't had the time to uh {disfmarker} have , you didn't have time to uh {disfmarker} to make a very uh qualitati qualitative uh presentation . Yeah . So you used uh this uh the different PowerPoint presentations uh in which you put your uh material in the {disfmarker} Oh . {vocalsound} That wasn't me . Uh {vocalsound} so um {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} Wasn't me . the means , we discussed the smart board , and what about uh this digital pen ? I {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I I used it , I didn't use it at all . {vocalsound} it it was {disfmarker} you can use it , it's quite handy I think . Yeah , well But I didn't {disfmarker} I uh {disfmarker} I use it as a a normal pen and and and only you use it to uh get it on the computer , Yeah , I used it to y to {disfmarker} huh ? Yeah , it did work pretty well . I used it too , but {disfmarker} oh well . I don't think why you would want to use it actually , Yeah . I didn't use . Yeah , but it it does work . {vocalsound} because it shou No {disfmarker} yeah . Yeah . To make some designs , It is it is {disfmarker} it is very easy . yeah , it is easy for {disfmarker} to design something and then load it in your computer . Yeah . Yeah , and then you can show it to everybody . But to write it th yeah . Yeah . It doesn't really write normally . Yeah . It's b bi little bit too big to write . It's a bit {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Yeah , it's too big , it's too fat . {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} Yeah . Yeah . Fat document , those . {vocalsound} Okay , um and what about the teamwork ? I think it was great , Team work was okay . Yeah , well I think so too . yeah . Yeah . {gap} we {disfmarker} Only thing that we worked through , past each other . Yeah , Right . but that was {disfmarker} it was our assignment , With some things that was only problem , Yeah , but it was because we didn't uh {disfmarker} but {disfmarker} huh ? Yeah . Yeah yeah yeah , Okay , but furthermore better . and maybe I should walk out of the room when you discuss uh this point , the leadership . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} That's {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} I thought it was good , but uh {disfmarker} Yeah . Yeah . yeah , no prob . Ah . Yeah well , okay . {vocalsound} Yeah . Not too much , not too too too too {gap} . Yeah . Yeah . Okay . And creativity ? Well , when we look at this I'd say we have been creative , {vocalsound} {vocalsound} huh ? But {disfmarker} Well . Yeah , or the room for {disfmarker} There was room for {disfmarker} it was the idea to be creative , so {disfmarker} Yeah . You got some standard ideas in your head {vocalsound} and this what came out . Mm-hmm . And you get get stuff from the from the computer , Yeah . but {disfmarker} The information uh was sometimes uh a little bit too late Little bit uh lo yeah . Too late {disfmarker} Yeah . or {disfmarker} it it it took a lot of time before you got your ema You just sit there for ten minutes . Yeah , {gap} Yeah . yeah . where is that email ? I played I think seven times Solitaire something . {vocalsound} You did ? Well , {vocalsound} Oh {vocalsound} I didn't have time for that . did you ? Is it on there ? {vocalsound} Is it on there ? Wha I didn't find the {disfmarker} didn't look but uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {gap} At some times I {disfmarker} Sometimes I received like like five emails at at one moment , {vocalsound} Was searching and searching . Oh right , I didn't look , it is there . but {disfmarker} and then {disfmarker} No , I I never got that . {gap} {vocalsound} I always {disfmarker} I got like one email after ten minutes or something . I even got spam . {vocalsound} Or something like that . {vocalsound} N yeah . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} That's what we said . {vocalsound} So does this {disfmarker} I think lik oh and information was a bit low I think , sometimes , And it {disfmarker} not a lot uh {disfmarker} in in in in the beginning I didn't understand what what to do . No , the first one . No , w I didn't know {disfmarker} I didn't know uh {disfmarker} Yeah , like I {disfmarker} with with the remote {gap} and I never new we have t we had to uh {disfmarker} yeah made a made a rec a remote control . Make a r nee . yeah . And I didn't know what to do for the first ten minutes before we got here , Yeah , so {disfmarker} so I went , right . {vocalsound} Yeah . No stepping on the table and then looking at the internet page . Yeah . {vocalsound} And I was working and working and work {vocalsound} Just looking at the screen and uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} No . Okay , well um So , yeah . {disfmarker} but after all we can say uh we are satisfied , but it it could've been uh better . Yeah . When we get uh {disfmarker} when we have {disfmarker} we would have gotten uh more information . Yeah , an Yeah , Mm-hmm . Faster . more information about the costs . Yeah , that will be handy . Yeah . First of all I didn't think uh that we were able to make an L_C_D_ screen uh {disfmarker} first point , {vocalsound} Yeah . but uh it was possible uh {disfmarker} uh , yeah . Yeah , it only costs four units . Uh {vocalsound} yeah . Yeah . Yea uh so tha actually you could make an L_C_D_ screen but no mic , or it could make mic but no L_C_D_ screen , when you look at that . Yeah , that was a bit mean to put it in the end . Yeah . Yeah . {vocalsound} And uh what were the other points to to improve this whole process ? {vocalsound} Uh , I dunno . Um {disfmarker} Yeah . Think that's about it . Nothing . Hmm . I think we got it already . Heavier um {disfmarker} less heavy laptops . Yeah , they're pretty heavy . Uh . Faster laptop . Yeah . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah . Uh . They were they were just fine . But that's not really uh {disfmarker} And furthermore the the the network was okay . Yeah . Uh . Everything you loaded was also Yeah , everything worked . av available there . Right . And so more time uh w might have improved the the quality of work , So {disfmarker} is what you say . Yeah . Okay . Yeah . Yeah , but that {disfmarker} It's now half past four {disfmarker} half past three , so {disfmarker} Yeah , but it's just the the off hours between that you will work alone . Yeah , okay . Yeah , okay . Then it pops up {disfmarker} pop up screen came . Five minutes in the meeting . Mm-hm . Mm . No . {vocalsound} Mm . Yeah . Okay , so more time during the individual work phases . Um okay well uh Huh . I just got my warning for the last five minutes , so I'll move on to I guess my last slide , You did ? Well {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} yes , which is the closing . Well uh , we managed , but we did it very quickly . I don't know if that's the best way to {disfmarker} when it isn't {disfmarker} is it {disfmarker} when it is too expensive to quickly re-arrange it and say , okay , this is it , Oh , right . but we had to do it , Well {disfmarker} huh , because we have to have a design , and that is within the budget . And we evaluated . Maybe we should re-evaluate uh the product , but we did that before , and we also evaluated the project . And I think uh everybody's uh very happy . At least I am , with the results , {vocalsound} so uh celebration , well , for the three of you , {vocalsound} Yeah . Yeah . because uh I have to write the final report now . Champagne . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} But uh {vocalsound} well , thank you very much for your co-operation , {vocalsound} and I had a very nice day so far . {vocalsound} Yeah , sure . No prob . Oh thank you . Mm-hmm . Okay . Do we get another email ? {vocalsound} Bling . {vocalsound} You're fired . {vocalsound} Um {disfmarker} I think you do . I I think we have to fill in a questionnaire again , Yeah I have t but {disfmarker} I think we also have to go to our own rooms again , but um {disfmarker} well We do ? Mm . I at least . But maybe you can try uh to make a screen shot of this , so I can try to include it in the final report . Yeah . Uh th that that one ? You cannot {disfmarker} Yeah , maybe . You can just {disfmarker} you can save it . {gap} wants to , but at least this one . Yeah , but it's {disfmarker} it isn't a picture or , well , is it ? I know , we should remove this , You s uh file save as the J_ PEG J_ PEG . but it won't h Okay . And uh please put it in the project folder then , huh . Can you find it as a J_ PEG ? No , No . {vocalsound} isn't possible . But you can make a screen shot , I think . Okay , well I uh {disfmarker} {gap} No . {gap} No . I hereby officially close the meeting and uh I hope to see you uh soon . {vocalsound} Yeah . Okay . {vocalsound} In uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} In about five minutes .

        "summarize": "This is the fourth meeting. Project Manager began a detailed design meeting with Industrial Designer and User Interface's overall design presentation. Industrial Designer and User Interface introduced the remote control was green with a light-blue screen of LCD, scroll and microphone function and the RR logo. Marketing put up a questionnaire so group members discussed and evaluated remote design. The final average score was two. Then the group calculated production cost. After calculation, the production cost was eighteen fifty and surpassed the company's budget. So the design was changed and functions such as scroll and microphone were lost to satisfy the budget. The group evaluated the project and gave some suggestions about the whole process."

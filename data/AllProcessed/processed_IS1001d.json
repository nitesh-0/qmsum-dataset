        "transcript": "Okay . {vocalsound} Je croix que c'est dommage de le {disfmarker} it will be sad to destroy this prototype . It really looks like a banana . {vocalsound} It is a banana . It is a banana . {vocalsound} It is the essence of bananas . I would be confused with this thing . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Mm . {vocalsound} S Okay . Mm-hmm . {vocalsound} How is everyone ? Hi . Hi . So we are here for the detailed design meeting . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} So {vocalsound} Mm-hmm . we will uh {disfmarker} I will first present what we are going to do in this meeting . Then uh I've {disfmarker} I will also take notes during this meeting and I will send you uh a summary then as usual . We will then look at the evaluation criteria of the prototype presented by uh our two colleagues that make good work . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} And uh then we will see the financial aspects and the cost of the product . Then we will uh evaluate the product . And uh end with the conclusion of this project and see whether it fits with {disfmarker} it fulf if it fulfil the requirement or not . So Mm-hmm . d let's start with the cost aspect so so I look at the aspect discussed last time , that is to say uh to have a standard battery , {vocalsound} to have a yellow banana shaped uh case with uh a rubber material around it {vocalsound} to be uh to feel spongy , Like a banana . {vocalsound} and uh also at the different aspect like having a wheel etcetera . {vocalsound} Mm-hmm . And the cost ended to be ten point seven Euros . So which is uh good , because we had a price gap of twelve point five Euros . Mm-hmm . So for the financial aspect it's okay , we can uh {disfmarker} we can continue with this product uh as if , {vocalsound} {vocalsound} and we are now going to see the project evaluation with uh our marketing expert . {vocalsound} Yeah . Okay . So uh you can have my project in {disfmarker} Yeah . You have a presentation ? Uh yeah just a {disfmarker} Participant four , yes . {vocalsound} Four . Evaluation . Okay . Okay . Okay . So you can go . We can go through . Okay . So I made an evaluation and the the evaluation criteria is made according to {vocalsound} the users' requirements and the market trends we talked about uh during the previous uh meetings . So you can go through and {disfmarker} Okay . okay so uh we have uh six points . We we talked about before . Okay . So we we want to have a product fancy look and feel , technologically innovative , easy to use , fashion , {vocalsound} easy to find in a room , and robust , Yeah . Mm-hmm . uh and uh uh I have a scale of uh seven points . Yeah . Okay . So I go through all the uh all the points here , Yeah . and uh according to what you think about the this project you can uh mm make a one point , two point or seven point . Okay ? Okay . And after we ha we have an an average , and uh we see . Okay . Mm-hmm . The {disfmarker} okay ? {vocalsound} Uh so uh fancy look and feel , what do you think ? Okay . Maybe you can presen {vocalsound} F between o one and seven . okay . Maybe {disfmarker} {vocalsound} hold it . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} So I think it's uh very uh very nice . What do you think ? I give it a {disfmarker} I give it a five . Yeah . So it's between one and seven ? Seven is the highest uh ? Yeah . {vocalsound} Seven is the {disfmarker} I will give a six . I will give a a five . {vocalsound} Mm-hmm . {vocalsound} And you ? {gap} sorry . Do you vote uh Christine ? {gap} eh ? Do you also vote ? {vocalsound} No , I just want to see something {disfmarker} Maybe we all have to agree on a common {disfmarker} Well , we can {gap} very easily {vocalsound} . Yeah . Mm-hmm . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Uh I think uh {gap} {vocalsound} and need to {gap} as well {vocalsound} . No problem . So {vocalsound} Need to {disfmarker} this is your {disfmarker} uh I don't know if you {disfmarker} we ha we have to put uh one uh f If it's better or {disfmarker} One is most {gap} . I {disfmarker} Uh-uh . Well , we can choose what we want . Um . Yeah . Okay , let's say that seven is the best . Or maybe we can say s seven is the best mm {vocalsound} . Okay . So so do note the grade we have five , six for me , Five . five . And what what's your choice ? Oh sorry . {vocalsound} How much would you give on the fancy aspect , on the fashionable aspect ? Six {disfmarker} Uh s you can {disfmarker} how much what ? How much would you {disfmarker} you don't answer to this uh questionnaire ? Oh yes I mm I dunno mm , I think six , it's a good uh {disfmarker} So it will have five point five average . Five point five average . Yeah . Okay . Mm . Wa can {gap} . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Okay . Well , does it {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I sorry . {vocalsound} Okay . So after , the technological aspect ? Okay , techne technological aspect . So we we said uh we have uh a new technological uh thing with a wheel . Yeah , we have the wheel . We also have the rubber material , Uh . which make it uh like new also . I think I would give a five . It's {gap} four . Four ? A four also , because , except for the wheel , we don't have so much innovation . Yeah . The rubber is {disfmarker} Okay . Uh a four . I I {disfmarker} D are we including the voice {disfmarker} are you glu are we including the voice in the end or not ? Huh ? No . No . Okay . So No . what's your uh grade ? Four . Four ? So we have four , four f and five ? We can put four ? Yeah . Yeah , four . Four , yeah , let's put four . For twenty five . Everyone is okay or {disfmarker} four poin Four . Yeah . Okay . Doesn't it {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Very easy to use . Do you think it's easy to use ? Yeah , I think so . Yeah . Yeah . I give a seven , I think . Six . I would give a {disfmarker} I would give a seven as well . It's very easy to use . Six . Mm , six for me also . So 'Kay . Six point five . {vocalsound} six point five . Six six six point five . Okay . Okay . {vocalsound} Is it fashion ? {vocalsound} Oh yeah , {vocalsound} its its f its fruit fruit shape . Seven ? {vocalsound} I would say seven . And is very very nice design . Yeah it's fashion , because it's a fruit , Yeah , we can we can put a seven here . and we say that the {disfmarker} Yeah , seven . Yeah . yeah , seven . Yeah . Seven , okay . Yeah . Well , we hope . {vocalsound} Easy to find . {vocalsound} Uh easy to find in a room ? {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} I lost my banana . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} I think you can't miss it . {vocalsound} Yeah . Okay . Yeah ? Uh . Yeah , I think it's cool . I think we can put a six here . We have the lightning , or {disfmarker} Yeah , we have {vocalsound} the {vocalsound} The lighting . we don't sesh especially have the lightning {vocalsound} So you'll make the material transparent but {disfmarker} {vocalsound} so that it uh lights up completely , or {disfmarker} So it's yellow . It's okay . {vocalsound} Yeah . {gap} I think it's very easy to {vocalsound} {disfmarker} Seven ? I would say seven . It's hard to miss it . {vocalsound} Six . Yeah , okay . Yeah . Is it {disfmarker} is it robust ? Yeah , it's rubber , made of rubber , Uh f yeah , it's ru it's rubber . I think it's m it's uh more rubber than uh other remote control . Yeah . {vocalsound} Yeah the only problem there might be {disfmarker} which {gap} know , i if it's very sensitive , Yeah . they will , Yeah . I don't know {disfmarker} But it is uh {disfmarker} it is surrounded by rubber material . Yeah . Yeah , okay . So maybe we can put a six . Yeah . Mm . {vocalsound} Everybody is okay , six . Six or five . Five {vocalsound} Six is okay ? Six , yeah , for me . Six . Yeah . {vocalsound} Okay . Yeah . Yeah . S now {vocalsound} um so . Tadada . We have to sum up everything . Twenty . Thirteen uh , twenty , twenty six point five , uh seven , thirty two , thirty six {gap} . Thirty . Thir That's that's okay ? Six . {vocalsound} Six is a good {disfmarker} Okay . Good . Uh if we say that seven it's uh it's the better , Yeah , the be . {gap} Yeah , the top {disfmarker} and when uh s six sit six are good {disfmarker} it's a good uh p product , I think . Okay , so six is a {disfmarker} Mm . So will become eight soon ? So it's a good evaluation , I think . It's very promising . Yeah , well it's a bit biased . {vocalsound} Huh . We have a good price and uh {vocalsound} . Yeah . So this prototype is quite nice . {vocalsound} Okay . Good . Because I saw uh some phones that were banana shaped , uh wireless phones not mobile ones , wireless for the house , {vocalsound} Yeah . Okay . uh quite big also , {vocalsound} and they were selling {gap} something like a hundred Euros , two hundred Euros . {vocalsound} Just a {vocalsound} just a phone , wireless . So having this at twenty five Euros is uh quite attractive , I think . Mm-hmm . Yeah . I think the {disfmarker} But almo also the complexity between a phone and a remote control is not {disfmarker} cannot compare . Yeah . Yeah , Yeah . it's much more complex , but {disfmarker} So , I think , we can summarise . So we have seen the prototype . It's very nice according to the work of our two designer . {vocalsound} The the the financial aspect were okay . We we have the cost below uh our threshold and so we could sell at twenty five Euros and make i make profit . The the evaluation give satisfying result as well . So I think we can move to the last part of the meeting . {vocalsound} So the cost is in the budget , the evaluation is okay , so I th I think we can now uh open champagne and make a huge party . {vocalsound} Start to eat banana . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} I don't know if it's provided by uh by the meeting staff . {vocalsound} Mm-hmm . Okay . {vocalsound} Okay so congratulation . {vocalsound} Nice product . Yeah . {vocalsound} Congratulations to the team . Uh very well , we worked together fantastically . {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} I think it was a good collaboration uh . Aspect . {vocalsound} So what does the management say ? Sorry ? What does the management say ? I think we will have um much bigger project next time and a much bigger salary as well . Ah . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} All it depends on who watch this meeting . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} We don't know . {vocalsound} Yeah . Okay , so Okay . good guys {vocalsound} , {vocalsound} so see you for next uh successful project . {vocalsound} Okay . Yeah . Fruits . Mm 'kay . Mm .",
        "summarize": "In the development of the project, this meeting was at the basis where a prototype of the product had been designed and it mainly focused on discussion about the cost and pricing of the product based on the material it used and the profit they wanted to obtain through this product. It turned out that the cost was very reasonable and the price was also very attractive. Then, the team evaluated the product by scoring according to criteria based on the user's requirements and marketing trends. The meeting went very well and every team member agreed with each other on the evaluation results, which was promising to lead a success in this project."

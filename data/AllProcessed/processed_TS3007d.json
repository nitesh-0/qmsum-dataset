        "transcript": "{vocalsound} Wouldn't wanna be Project Manager . {vocalsound} Uh , what we going to do . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Um , once again I'm uh gonna take minutes . So , um no presentation for me . Uh , first we have a prototype presentation by G_ and G_ . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Afterwards some uh Yo . J_ and J_ . {vocalsound} eval eval evalu Evaluation . evaluation Evaluation criteria . Evaluation . s {vocalsound} sorry . {vocalsound} Uh evaluation crit criteria . Uh , in combination with the finance I um {vocalsound} uh I received uh a an uh an Excel uh file {vocalsound} Hmm . which we have to fill in later on . Um , you see . Uh , and then we must see uh if we uh stay under the twelve and a half Euro . Hmm . Interesting . Ah , okay . So , that's uh that's a big {vocalsound} Oops . {vocalsound} Cool . {vocalsound} Mm-hmm . That's gonna be t problem . l so let's uh wait it uh um {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} we have we have must {disfmarker} uh , Some creative uh {disfmarker} we must have uh some time for that uh because it will be uh {disfmarker} yeah , quite a lot of mathematics . Oh . Yeah . And after that , uh uh an evaluation of uh the process how we uh how we have done it here with the SMARTboard , with the with our laptops , with the {disfmarker} all uh all this . And uh afterwards , uh we closing . Once again , forty minutes , so uh let's start . Ok okay . I would g give the word to um G_ and G_ for the prototype presentation . Shall I give a short introduction and then uh {disfmarker} Yeah , well sure . J_ and J_ . J_ and J_ . Okay . {vocalsound} J_ and J_ , okay . Jane and Jane . {vocalsound} 'Kay guys , take it away . Take it away . Hi . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Um , this was our first concept . We decided to use a single touch-screen . So , we've worked out this concepts , how to how to hold it , where to put the buttons and and stuff . And um , well , we began with uh with a form of shape , that is uh is easy to hold w in one hand , left or right handed . {vocalsound} So , we made i it a little bit less thick and uh it has some ar artistic meaning . No ? This uh isn't nothing . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Idea maybe uh is better . {vocalsound} Um well , during the meeting I showed you the concept of uh placing the buttons on top , usable with your thumb , and uh the menu structure , uh if necessary , with your other hand , so it's just gonna hold it easily . {vocalsound} And it has to be acce accessible with your uh other hand too , of course . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} So we began uh working out a concept . Yeah , uh well , and as you saw , we would just have the basic remote with the panel L_C_D_ uh screen . Well , these would be the main buttons , h you could uh change them later on in your own profile if you want to . But , well it's standard they will be delivered with this kind of uh set-up . We have the {gap} more advanced menu uh setting right here . We have the sub-menus and stu stuff . We made a top {disfmarker} oh , or a front view . Just so like you wanna uh back view . As you can see , this uh {disfmarker} there , there are uh two uh weird bumps in it . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} This is for uh the added uh effect of uh well uh y youth and dynamic . And uh this is for the artistic effect . {vocalsound} Well , what we figured is uh we'll show you a picture {gap} later on {gap} you have more b a better idea after that . But , idea is for to stay in balance with these two uh {disfmarker} with these two . Hmm . And so when you put it on the table , it will just {gap} lay down . It won't {vocalsound} uh roll around or stuff . But it will lie more in your hand like an old telephone maybe , or like these old uh phones . Mm . Y you you may get the idea . So thi this is about uh how we figured it should be . The s panel we g you would hide with some more uh rubber layers , like we discussed early on . Uh , you would s you wouldn't see the uh straight panel , but more fluidly and round . Yeah , the panel just uh of course goes like this . Yeah . But the overlaying layer is uh a little bit uh curved and stuff . No , okay . Okay . And uh , in these bumps you could actually uh {gap} put some electronics uh that would {disfmarker} you can make a more thinner uh design , Yeah . and that would actually look very nice , yeah . Yeah . And uh , about the colour , what have {disfmarker} Yeah . Oh , we added that this um can be held with your hands for this {disfmarker} maximum is om yeah , one and a half centimetres . So , you have room here for your battery and maybe even other um electronic chips . S and you can just be the the layer of the touchscreen and some {disfmarker} have some wires underneath it to make it as uh thin as possible in the middle for good grip . Okay . Hmm . {vocalsound} Yeah , f uh , as colours , do you do you have the picture in uh {disfmarker} Yeah . Oh yeah . Now , well this is the idea about uh the bumps . Uh , you can see there's a v a very uh youthful uh dynamic uh exterior . It uh {disfmarker} you just want to hold it you uh you are young and uh dynamic like us . 'S l {disfmarker} it's like an uh Easter egg . Yeah . Yeah , it's like an e but this is for children . We we want a more adult version . But , this is like a remote control for children . {vocalsound} It's called a weemote {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {gap} . A weemote . Weemote . Weemote . Yeah . Hey , that's actually a brilliant uh marketing stand . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} Uh , but {vocalsound} {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Wait what I w got in mind . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} So this actually basic the idea . We we just want to build a more uh adult vers adult version of of this . Yeah , I can imagine that . Mm-hmm . {vocalsound} And and for colours , we we figured starting with basic colours like uh white or metallic grey . Those are the technological colours actually , Yeah . It would be best to to appeal to a broad public and make the covers exchangeable , so it d so the young people will buy an orange and a red and blue and a purple , Or blue or whatever . but when the o older people uh go in the shop and they see uh an orange um remote control , it would be less appealing than a white one . And young people , we think , are a little bit more flexible , Hmm . they think , ah I'll buy for a couple of Euros some noi nice hip uh {disfmarker} Hmm . Maybe it's an idea to sell it without a cover , so that you can pick a cover in the in the shop . Well , um I think a cover is necessary , 'cause als otherwise you'll just have the L_C_D_ screen . Yeah , okay . Yeah , okay . So , there must be some cheap standard cover , um maybe white or something , Hmm . Mm . that's could comes with it and you can buy , so we can make extra money . Yeah , but uh you d you mustn't forget that uh our target aim is younger people . Oui okay . Uh , we had decided to uh put uh some flashy fruity colours in it , uh and uh in the survey from uh Milan and Paris uh it uh it came out that uh uh the d the older people are uh more willing to uh to spend money on extra features . So I think uh it will be a better idea to have some uh flashy fruity colours as as a standard , Okay . The other way around , you mean . {gap} Oh yeah . and for the people who uh really want uh a more sophisticated , more traditional look , they're willing to pay uh that . Uh-huh . They want uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} they want more luxury stuff , Yeah . but they have the money to do it and they want to b to buy that . Mm-hmm . So , maybe it's an idea to put that as an extra and not as a standard . Okay . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah , maybe {disfmarker} yeah , perhaps you're right . Uh , I I would I would actually agree with this sounds logical . Okay , yeah . An another idea . Uh , maybe we could uh develop a cover uh with wood style . Yeah . {vocalsound} They'll please the elder users as well . Yeah . Well yeah , a colour of {disfmarker} a wood style , a white c and uh a couple of h hip uh fruity colours . {vocalsound} Yeah . And lea uh l delivered standard with a fruity colour , but not too not too much . Nah . Yeah . Yes . Not not too uh {disfmarker} yeah . This is banana and mango , not not purple or p orange and yellow . Yeah , exactly . Yeah . But , the mai I think th uh the standard must be some kind of uh uh attractive flashy colours . Yeah . Or blue or {disfmarker} Not too , but w a little , Ah . Mm-hmm . because that's our aim . Yeah , Yeah . li like like this like this . Yeah . This isn't this isn't too much , is it ? Yeah , okay . No . Yeah . I f {gap} . Well , the buttons don't have to be uh all uh all of {gap} Yeah . {vocalsound} The buttons , Well I I I think so . I {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Yeah , except for the buttons it's {disfmarker} it could be a standard model . yeah . It {disfmarker} Yeah . Okay . Yeah , uh something like this would be nice . Okay . Okay . Okay , that's that's it from us . Thank you . 'Kay , it's my time now . It's my turn . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} The Marketing Expert . Uh-oh . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Okay . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} During the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Oh . {vocalsound} During the design uh design life-cycle we uh {vocalsound} Sorry . {vocalsound} we made lot of requirements and trend analysis and stuff . Um , now is the time to uh evaluate our prototype concept to uh to the past requirements . {vocalsound} So we are going to evaluate the design according to the past user requirements and trends analysis . Um , we're going to do that with a seven point scale . Opening a Word document now . Okay . One {disfmarker} oh , okay , uh I have to expla explain something . We have to uh be consensive about about things . So , it has to be a group uh group decision . Okay , Okay ? so we gon we gonna evaluate the Uh {disfmarker} We're going to vote . We {disfmarker} Yeah , the the thing we {gap} saw . yeah ? The prototype . Okay , just saw . Yeah . Okay , one . The remote control is designed for people with age below forty . Yeah . Seven ? {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Seven is false . Uh , true . {vocalsound} Sorry . Yeah , b one or {disfmarker} Yeah , one I think . Why ? Most true ? Yeah , it's not just uh designed for people under the age of forty . It's also designed for people above forty . Mm . Yeah , Yeah . Yeah . so {disfmarker} So {disfmarker} so a o one is appropriate ? No no , a little more in the middle . Or , more like a four . No , uh three or {disfmarker} yeah . I have {disfmarker} I've {disfmarker} Three . Yeah , two or three , because it's not just {disfmarker} uh the qu question is aimed at is it designed for people with age below forty . Okay . But it's also designed for people of age above forty . So , Ah , exactly . Exactly . I'll say it's about three . Yeah , Okay . it will be primary appealing to to m minus forty , but also appealing to {disfmarker} Three . {vocalsound} Yeah . But also for {disfmarker} yeah , okay . Uh , second . The remote control is beautiful . Yeah . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} It's {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Wow . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah , acco according to us , it's one ? Or {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah , {vocalsound} Yeah , I I think {disfmarker} it's the marketing uh angle on television . Yeah . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah , We have a wonderful {disfmarker} p s Of c of course you have to be uh very positive and uh enthusiastic about your own product . Yeah . {vocalsound} Well , it's also fancy then . Three . Uh , the remote control looks fancy . Yeah . Yes . Yeah . One ? Yep . Of course . We have a perfect remote . Yes . Good . Four . The remote control has big , clear channel switching buttons . Yes . Yeah yeah , oh they have to agree but {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah . Yes . Leads to user face , yeah . I'm the User Interface uh Expert . {vocalsound} Daniel . Uh , teletext buttons and volume buttons ? Um , uh no . No teletext buttons . Teletext is in the menu . You you've different menu . Yeah , false . False ? And volume is impo And volume ? Volume is true . yeah . True . Uh , hmm . Big and clear ? {vocalsound} Yeah , the they are big and clear . {gap} . Yeah yeah , big and clear . Yeah , big and clear . But you could make a teletext button uh six . Hey . Otherwise , the people who read this uh are gonna think we have no teletext button . Hey . Hide . {vocalsound} Yeah , but but the teletext button . Yeah , you can ch That's in a menu . {vocalsound} It's it's not {disfmarker} So , it's w yeah , it {disfmarker} it it yeah , it {disfmarker} it isn't entirely unclear , J but {disfmarker} So , I wouldn't give it a seven . No . I would give it a more a five or a six . Yeah . Five ? Uh , I don I don't know . Okay . What do you think , uh Mister Project Manager ? Yeah , it's it's {disfmarker} yeah . Oh , okay . Well , I agree . I was thinking very black and white . {vocalsound} Hmm . Black and red . {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Thank you J_ . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Okay , don't forget to save it . Uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Red . Okay . Volume . The remote control is easy to be found . Uh well , when we put in fancy colours , yeah {vocalsound} Fruity . {vocalsound} and {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Yeah , it has these {disfmarker} all these fruity colours and it has a strange shape . {vocalsound} Yeah . So , if you so if you have {vocalsound} trouble finding it {disfmarker} But , um it it's not making any sound uh , {vocalsound} have we deciding ? Oh , okay , So {disfmarker} but {disfmarker} If you put uh your normal uh remote control under your bed , or you throw this remote control under your bed , is it better findable ? {vocalsound} It'll make a difference . We have the better re {vocalsound} I don't know . Yeah , I think so . My remote control's black . A li little bit maybe ? A little bit , but {disfmarker} yeah . Yeah . Well , we p we can do it glow in the dark . Four ? Uh {disfmarker} Fi So , if it's in the dark place , you still see it glowing . {vocalsound} K yeah . I {disfmarker} Fo fo yeah fo five is {gap} . Ah , I I I think five . It's it's {disfmarker} it doesn't really make a lot of {disfmarker} Well , then uh then I'll go for four . Four ? {vocalsound} Because uh four is between three and uh uh also between between true and false . Yeah , okay , you're right . Uh , {vocalsound} Yes , but five is between four and six . {vocalsound} I think {disfmarker} so I'll I'll go for four . Ah , you must see it as uh , w uh according to uh the the other uh remote controls , there may uh uh be there in your uh T_V_ room , this one will stand out , I think . Wha Yeah . {vocalsound} B_ . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah , that that's a better question actually . Yeah , Exa I think that that's what it's about . Yeah . it {disfmarker} it's {disfmarker} If your uh fifteen remotes in a drawer , uh you find it , yeah ? If it {disfmarker} if this lying on your couch , you're you're {disfmarker} you think what's that for kinda orange uh thing . Yeah , yeah . So {disfmarker} But but the survey under users was that they uh really lost it . Yeah . Yeah , that's stupid . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Like , no not uh not seeing it , but lost it in the house or something . {vocalsound} Okay . Uh , but when you lost it you're just not {disfmarker} But , okay . Well , if i if you see a strange shape lying somewhere , uh then you'd uh recognise it as , whoa , that is strange . {vocalsound} That's our remote control . {vocalsound} Yeah , mostly when you lose your remote control , it it's under your {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Yeah , okay . Yeah , I I agree , I agree . {vocalsound} Yeah . Yeah , what is that . Uh , Most of times when you lose it you're sitting on it . Uh {disfmarker} so it's {disfmarker} Okay . Eight , the remote control has fresh , fruity colours . True . {vocalsound} Um I would call uh {disfmarker} choose two , {vocalsound} 'cause we decided not to make two f uh fresh colours , as it would not {gap} . Yeah , yeah , not too flashy . Yeah . The remote control is made of soft material . {vocalsound} Um , Yeah , rubber , is kind of soft . Yeah , but not too soft we have decided . kinda soft , but but not this {gap} . Yeah . Three ? Three , yeah . Yeah . Yeah yeah , easy to use , Easy to use . One . {vocalsound} very afford . Easy to use ? Yeah , can it be zero ? {vocalsound} Well , {vocalsound} I don yeah , it is kind of {disfmarker} Top easy to use ? It {disfmarker} It's it's not the most easy to use {disfmarker} No , you can do two , because um No . Uh {disfmarker} It can be easier . it can be easier . But then you're l It could {disfmarker} yeah . Jus just with ten buttons , that's the easiest . yeah , but then you'll lose {gap} Yeah . function f yeah , functionality and our fancy uh look , so . Functional ability . Yeah , but the most uh easy to use is just with one button But {disfmarker} It is r it is rather easy to use , because you have the primary buttons always visible . {vocalsound} on t {vocalsound} Yeah , okay , but easy n not not the most easy to use , I think . {gap} {gap} . No . No , it's it {disfmarker} I I'll go for two . My vote's on two . {vocalsound} Two ? Okay , two . Yeah , two . Yeah , m mine too . We also have to compare it to the uh to the remote controls on the market nowadays . So {disfmarker} Yeah , but waits just a minutes . Inspiration . What's the time ? We also have uh to do the evaluation , uh the production costs and uh stuff . These are the m regular remotes . Yeah yeah , I'm uh hurrying . {vocalsound} Okay , eleven . The remote control is innovative . Yeah . Yes , true , one . Yes . You're agree , Tim ? A very {disfmarker} of course . You haven't seen a more innovative uh thing in uh Paris ? {vocalsound} The remote control has m remova {vocalsound} removable {gap} from Multilux . {vocalsound} Yes , one . Very multifunctional . {vocalsound} No . The remote control , i it has speech recognition . False . Yes , False . it {disfmarker} This is used with speech recognition , this . The remote control has built-in games ? {vocalsound} Yes . But uh , maybe make it two , because the games are in a sub-menu and not uh {disfmarker} it's not an entire game . Yeah , but they are built in , so it's one . Yeah , they are built in . Yeah , okay . Yeah . {vocalsound} Okay . {gap} {vocalsound} Not down . And the last , paren {vocalsound} parental advisory function . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} You really like the parental advisory . {vocalsound} Yes . Freak . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yes , {vocalsound} I do . Th did you make this or the {disfmarker} Bu Save as . Yeah , he made it . {vocalsound} Yeah , {gap} {disfmarker} It changes it maybe . Okay , I will uh Oh yay . do the the math . Oh dear . Now it's your turn . Okay , thank you . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} We'll see . Hmm ? Mm . Okay , we have now to c uh to calculate the production cost . If it's under uh twelve and half Euro , then it's uh ok uh okay . But i is it {disfmarker} if it is b Huh ? No , this isn't right . Okay so , {gap} . Redesign . If they're under twelve fifty . Oh yeah , if they under {disfmarker} Yeah . No . Oh yeah . Yeah , it's {disfmarker} Yeah ? Cau 'cause {disfmarker} so it's okay . {vocalsound} sorry . Yeah , if the costs are under twelve and a half Euro , uh then we uh can uh ra uh move on to the project evaluation , as we have uh experienced it . Otherwise , we have uh do uh have to do a little uh redesign uh thingy . So {disfmarker} Uh , we have to fill in the numbers of the component uh components . We have to uh fil uh , want to uh do it in and uh see uh if we stay under the twelve and a half Euro . So , do we have uh a hand dynamo ? No . No . That's zero . Me , too . Battery , yes . One . Battery , one ? Yes . One , yeah . Yeah . Okay . Kinetic , one ? Kinetic , one . Yeah . Yeah . Okay , solar cells , zero . Yeah . {vocalsound} Yeah . Okay , uh simple chip on print ? Uh , n no . No . No ? No , advanced chip . No . No . Advanced chip . Yes . Sample sensor sample speaker ? No , the advanced chip is uh {disfmarker} No . Advanced chip is three . Three ? Three Euros , yep . Yeah uh , but it it's one one thing , it's three Euro . Yeah . Uh , we have one . We have one {disfmarker} Okay , one piece , yeah . {gap} . Uh , what's the sample sensor ? No , sev zero . No . Well , that's um {disfmarker} Speech recognition , I think . Yeah , you give it a sample , uh one . yeah , speech recognition Okay . and s Zero . Uh , uncurved flat . No . No . A zero . No . But is it s it's not made from a single uncurved thingy and then uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} and then uh {disfmarker} You {disfmarker} no . No . No . No . Thingy . {vocalsound} no ? Okay . {vocalsound} So it's only uh once double-curved . Yeah . Yeah , Yes , 'cause um the layer around it fits around the bubbles on the o on the uh the back of the {disfmarker} three . Eight . Okay . We're now in a problem , 'cause uh we have uh reached eleven Euro yet . {vocalsound} Uh , we don't have anything else . So {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Okay , go on . Just go on . Okay , but uh we have {disfmarker} Just go on . Then we'll see uh {disfmarker} we'll we'll see uh wha how much we are over budget . Okay . Could you step a little to the right ma Two . Yeah . Oh , sorry . Two . Uh , rubber . Or {disfmarker} You . Zero . Titanium , no ? {vocalsound} And zero . Special uh {disfmarker} is the special colour ? Special colour ? Mm . I don't think so . No , this is a standard colour . No . {vocalsound} Yeah , but we want to make uh the wood colours , uh that uh {disfmarker} Yeah . {vocalsound} S {vocalsound} Yes , this is a special colour . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah , if if you're honest , we'll uh type one , special colour . {vocalsound} Yeah , but but D but Daniel , tha that's that's another brand . {vocalsound} That's an add-on . Yeah , one . That's another article to sell . Yeah . Yeah , but we we going to {disfmarker} yeah yeah , that's true . But yeah , it's it's {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} Uh , j maybe we'll finish uh the the list first and then look back , aye ? That doesn't account for this . Producing this . Okay , the push-button , no . No . Scroll wheel , no . Scroll-wheel , no . {gap} {disfmarker} No . No . Oh , no . Yes , one . {gap} {disfmarker} Uh , button , no . One , yeah . No , the the {disfmarker} No . No . Mm , is it {disfmarker} we don't have a s No . No . These three . no . Okay . Well , we're only four Euro over budget . No . Oh , okay . So , um what's the thing we can change ? So {disfmarker} But {disfmarker} No . No . Well , other case , we can make it single-curved or uncurved . Uh , can I uh I say something ? Mm , single-curves . Yeah . No , can I say something uh as Project Manager ? Yeah , of course . {vocalsound} Yeah . The kinetic thing , can we just skip it , Just cut off the kine yeah . because uh you have to shake it , but that's not really innovative . Or {disfmarker} Yeah . Okay , sure . yeah . {vocalsound} Yeah , we just put a good battery it it . Yeah . Mobile phones nowadays . Yeah . Daniel . Daniel , Yo . Sorry , what do you think about {disfmarker} Here . yeah , yes . {vocalsound} What do you think about uh putting a battery in it , but also selling like uh the covers , a docking station Yeah . just apart from the from the thing , so that you can uh put uh Mm-hmm . {vocalsound} rechargeable batteries in it and just {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Okay . But you can use rechargeable batteries anyway , just you s you have to recharge them manual . Yeah , and not really {gap} . Yeah , yeah , okay . But we {disfmarker} if you forget about the kinetic , Just an idea . Yeah , that's a cost reduc Yeah , sure . Yeah . well if we do that , we shall {gap} . Ah . {vocalsound} Okay , So um {disfmarker} well you you can go from double-curved to single-curved . Yeah , of course . And that would solve the budget problem . Uh , b but i but the single-curved is just {disfmarker} oh {disfmarker} Yeah , so we have to bake the ba back flat , and then {disfmarker} Yeah . No , it's it's just one curve and not a back uh curved I think . Or {disfmarker} It's just {disfmarker} yeah well , the single-curve that {disfmarker} Oh , okay , okay . Yeah . Exactly , yeah . So that's wh tha that's one option . {vocalsound} Or are these two curves ? Uh {disfmarker} Yeah . {vocalsound} And then w yeah , and then we could have it , but uh {disfmarker} it's its' well it's it's r it is the main point of the the the the look . Yeah , {gap} {disfmarker} {gap} {disfmarker} Yeah , but what else uh do we have to cut out ? No advanced chip , uh that's a little bit of problem . We going to cut {disfmarker} No , tho uh that that can be done . Yeah . So uh , Although , can we make it with a regular chip ? okay , a little less uh conversation . Curvy . Hey , those ar arcs , why are there for ? Sorry ? The blue blue uh Fill in {gap} {disfmarker} Just a Explanation . Okay . explanation . Twelve fifty . I can delete it for you if you want . Well {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} No , no no . So , if we do this , uh we're on uh twelve and a half Euro . And we're done . Yeah , but does it fit with our design ? {vocalsound} Uh well , the only uh thing that don't {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Do we have to u adapt it ? It's single-curves . Yeah , single-curved , but there's a curve in it . So {disfmarker} Yeah . W Could we just make the bubbles uh cut off the back , and then we're uh has {disfmarker} Yeah , we just make it flat . Okay . But , you do l But , wha 'Kay , look , what is the uh {disfmarker} If you make it double-curved , it costs one Euro more . More . Yeah . You make it optional . But {disfmarker} No , but does it have a lot of extra uh {gap} Function . Functional . fun function more like {disfmarker} Worth , does it have added worth ? Uh , there's an a a athe aesthetic value , but not functionality . Yeah . No , um {disfmarker} Yeah , it's really a static value . Yeah . Yeah , uh aesthetic . I mean , uh you make like eleven and a half Euros profit instead of twelve and a half . But {disfmarker} I don't know if twelve and a half is uh a fixed uh fixed price . Yeah , it is . Oh . Yeah , well let's assume it is . No , we can't go above that . We we should assume it i that it is . Yeah ? Yeah , okay . Yeah . But I I figured that the kinetic would be a marketing promotion . Yeah , okay . Then it's okay . R if you uh promote a kinetic um {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} kinetic remote control , I mean , that would b sell better than an {disfmarker} a normal remote control . Yeah . Yeah . Do you think ? Well , now you can shake your remote {gap} control . {vocalsound} Yeah , I think so . No , well , y I mean uh , y you can go into your neighbour and tell him , ha , my k uh remote control is kinetic . {vocalsound} Kinetic . Yeah . You have standard old battery control uh remote con Yeah . Yeah . What a what about all the m the environment freaks ? Yeah , but it doesn't fit in our co cost profile . So {disfmarker} Not freaks , {vocalsound} the envi No . True . I I think it's it's {disfmarker} It look like this one . You ma can make an an especialised extra gold version . Yeah ? Who {disfmarker} because if you want to go to kinetic , you're uh you're on thirteen and a half and you must go to flat , {vocalsound} and I think now it's it's more of uh a compromise Yeah . thing . Yeah . And if you make the single curve ha just a big curve , {vocalsound} then it's uh then it's uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Yeah , just one big curve . {vocalsound} yeah , one big good curve . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} I was going to uh say nasty words , but I don't . {vocalsound} This is strange by the way . {vocalsound} Wood is m is is is cheaper than rubber . We thought that wood would be more expensive . Yeah . Uh , this uh American figures . You just cut down some trees . {vocalsound} Yeah , maybe . But uh that {disfmarker} this is this is it ? Yeah . Okay , this is it . This is it . Whoever makes uh a remote control out of titanium . I'm gonna save it . Yeah . {vocalsound} Yes . {vocalsound} It is possible , but you can't use double uh curves for titanium . No . That's one of the functionability uh {disfmarker} Okay , well , considering we have {disfmarker} Ah no , we have to do all those hours again . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Go back . One back ? Costs on uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} No redesign . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Well , we were above , so we did a little redesign {disfmarker} Yeah . We sue . {vocalsound} We {vocalsound} Yeah , we'll start her all o all over again . Yeah , {gap} {disfmarker} okay , yeah . Okay , um now uh it's about time to uh talk about uh this project . Uh , some uh things . Were there uh room for uh {disfmarker} was there room for creativity in our meetings or in your individual meetings ? Um {disfmarker} Hmm . I I didn't think so . That {disfmarker} there was a lot of room for it . But , that's mainly because uh of the information that was delivered to us . Yeah . It was just fixed information and get your stuff from there , and I couldn't go on on i on the internet and search my own stuff . Bu Yeah . Yeah , yeah , yeah . That's true . I agree with that . Well , I th I think you two , {vocalsound} uh especially you and uh and uh Daniel , you d you you both had uh the less creative uh roles in the project . Yeah . That's true . Yeah . For us , there was a lot of creativity . 'Cause I think m We could just sign up an uh remote if we liked . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah , that's true . I think Jeroen and I , we had a more design {disfmarker} we could have more {disfmarker} we had more room for creativity than than you two . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah , that's true . Okay . Uh how about the leadership ? {vocalsound} Uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Ha . Leadership was uh crappy . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Crappy . {vocalsound} Cra {vocalsound} Nah , the leadership wasn't crappy , it was the leader that was crappy . {vocalsound} Okay , thank you very much . {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Okay . {vocalsound} Nah . No , the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} leadership was okay . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Now we're done . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah , example of crappy leadershi No , leadership was uh Okay , yeah . Yeah , it was good . {vocalsound} Okay , I thought uh the first meeting was a little bit of unstructured meeting . Yeah , that's true . Uh , you could have {disfmarker} but uh , it was your first , no uh no disrespect or something , {vocalsound} {vocalsound} but you could have uh structure it a l little bit more . Yeah . So like , I I was talking most of the time the first meeting meeting , and {disfmarker} You could of said , shut up you fool . {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} Yeah . Yeah . I notice it too . But {disfmarker} I was a I was also very uh unhappy , uh very unsatisfied uh about the About me . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {gap} about the first meeting . {vocalsound} So , uh I hope uh uh the the the other meetings uh Try to learn from your mistake . {vocalsound} And we will never do it again . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah , you made up . {vocalsound} get better and uh I think the the last two meetings uh also we we reached uh some good decisions about uh talk {disfmarker} No , it {disfmarker} you did better . Yeah , more more consensus . yeah . Ev everybody w was agreeing every {disfmarker} Yeah . Much more constructive . Okay , so uh that's cool . Yeah . Uh , teamwork ? Well , maybe that's uh only {disfmarker} Yeah well , it's for us , because uh {disfmarker} Well , we work together on a project , but everybody has his own task . Yeah . Yeah and it's wo more like presentation and some points were discussed . So , it is a little bit {disfmarker} {vocalsound} But , really teamwork were you two uh {disfmarker} Yeah . No {disfmarker} Well , it went okay . Two guys . The {disfmarker} Yeah , that went w it went well . Yeah ? It's it's just uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Stupid stupid pen , but uh {disfmarker} No hard feelings . Nah . Yeah , we we had some trouble with the pen , but {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Yeah . Now you you must push a little while . Yeah , but but draw something uh difficult . Yeah , but us {disfmarker} D uh just write your name right now . Yeah . Try to write your name , Okay . {gap} in in writing letters , of course , yeah ? Yeah , normally , uh this uh {disfmarker} the w Block letter sign it , yeah ? O Just uh {disfmarker} Just just write your name in in one line . okay . If it's a little bit too small {disfmarker} {gap} bit quicker now . You can be {disfmarker} you can go quicker , 'cause then it it won't notice it . It didn't {disfmarker} Uh he he knows how it works , yeah . {vocalsound} Oh . I follow the Master class for the SMARTboard , so I think that's the that's the main issue . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Okay . {vocalsound} Um , so uh about this one you were uh you're dealing with , Means . {vocalsound} um the the the the digital pen . Y well , yeah . Th the i The idea is great , but it doesn't work properly . Uh {disfmarker} Okay . Yeah . Digital pen , I thought uh th the first time I did individual work , I used it . Yeah . But , a and the first two meetings I brought it with me , but I didn't use it at all after the first the first meeting . No . Yeah . No , I have it working . But , uh yeah , well uh {disfmarker} It's it's not real real use for me . No , it doesn't have that much added value to the {disfmarker} Huh . Well {disfmarker} Nee . As uh as I said a m a c few moments ago , it {disfmarker} I would like , myself , to write with a normal pen , because must um {disfmarker} Yeah , it's almost the same concept , but you can just sim more simply put it on our scanner . Yeah . I it's the same concept as the pen , where you f have to download the software or s uh very uh slow . M yeah . Yeah . And it is still your own handwriting uh popping up in uh Word . Yes . No , and it doesn't give any added value . No , uh that's true . No . Not really , no . And uh the SMARTboard is uh useful , but the the pen is I uh {gap} {disfmarker} not user-friendly , I think . Yeah , not user-friendly . Yeah . Be it it takes a lot of time to draw things and to write things , {vocalsound} Yeah , and it's it's not very precise . and that's the {disfmarker} We're trying to m to {disfmarker} Yeah , like when you do this . Yeah , it may um {disfmarker} Yeah , and tr try to wri write your name uh in a in a normal uh size , yeah . Smaller . Smaller ? Yeah , smaller . Just like when you're writing on a letter . Yeah , but that's not th the the {disfmarker} you {disfmarker} when you {gap} at a foreign audience , you b don't gonna wr uh write uh small . No , a as you saw on on this drawing , just open open this one or that one . It's uh th it it {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Yeah , uh we had more problems even here when we trying to draw these buttons , it's almost impossible to get clear uh {gap} when you're uh {disfmarker} Yeah . Oh . Sorry . But maybe there's some function with {disfmarker} no , it isn't . With uh {disfmarker} And the eraser was another problem . It w t is is this large . {vocalsound} And when you try to erase this line , y {disfmarker} Yeah . Well , I'm gonna erase my uh name . {vocalsound} I'm gonna erase my name there . Yeah , it's a big uh big eraser . Okay . New ideas ? M Abo What kind of new ideas ? Um {disfmarker} Well , the the idea of the touch-screen is uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Do you ? Yeah , uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Go on . {vocalsound} I'm just uh {disfmarker} New ideas about uh the working of this software , about about the project , about the remote controls or {disfmarker} Yeah . Mm , yeah , I think so . I don't know what what I mean . {vocalsound} {gap} {vocalsound} No . Hello . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Did you heard what he said ? {vocalsound} Know what I mean . {vocalsound} I don't {vocalsound} I don't know what I mean . {vocalsound} Oh , I have some figure . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Here . {vocalsound} Oh . The eva the evaluation , Oh yeah . the mm the mean uh number is uh one point eight one point eight six . That's interesting . So that's fairly uh fairly good , I think . Okay , Yeah . because what does it mean ? So true . Uh , that uh All the mo yeah , are between one and two . all the requirements uh are true or very true , right . Yep . Yeah . Oh , okay . Yeah , okay . Thank you , expert . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} But the new ideas found for uh wi with working with this uh software ? Not really , just they have to improve it . Not really , yeah ? Uh , the concept is okay , Yeah , I think {disfmarker} but it has to be quicker . Uh , it is still opening my programme , n almo almost uh my entire computer is locked up during the process Yeah . and it , yeah , just takes too many time . People will still feel the need to to write it quickly on uh a page and not download it and save it , and {disfmarker} Yeah . You had expected it to to be uh more more uh {disfmarker} More user-friendly . Yeah . {vocalsound} 'Cause when you use a pen , you can just draw like you d draw normally , Yeah . Yeah . and you do May maybe the idea you proposed is uh a screen here . Yeah . And draw it , and it's it's placed over there . Yeah . Yeah , that l Yeah . Would be easier . Or at least when you {disfmarker} {vocalsound} you don't have to adapt to the technology , just you can write in the way you normally write . And now you have to um keep constantly in mind that you're drawing on this screen . Hmm ? No . And that's a very bad concept . Yep , yep . Yeah , that's true . Ah , very bad . Nah , okay , I I {disfmarker} it's my opinion that I {disfmarker} But {disfmarker} I think this is better than regular flip-overs , but {disfmarker} Yeah , it's can be saved easier . Yeah . But if you're in normal flip-over {disfmarker} you {disfmarker} a lot of people write text . There's no text option . Yeah . And writing text {disfmarker} uh , yeah , you've gotta really do your best to write some {disfmarker} Yeah , and and maybe some uh functions for uh {vocalsound} uh uh circle or uh a square . You have to draw it yourself now . Yeah . Or maybe even insert picture . Yeah . If you have uh some presentation , and you have some f Yeah . Or text function . Just t t type text , and that that would be uh excellent . Yeah . Yeah . Mean {disfmarker} Yeah , but insert image isn't available ? {vocalsound} 'Cause then you could {disfmarker} Here . Picture from scanner , clip-art . Yeah , that that can be done already . Oh , okay . But not the the the the predefined uh squares I think uh {disfmarker} So you can {disfmarker} Hyperlink ? Hey , what if you do like hyperlink ? With uh W_W_ dot Google dot com . Type type it ? Oh yeah . Maybe {gap} . Re Real Reaction dot N_L_ . Hmm ? Sorry ? Yes , is {disfmarker} now is okay . Okay ? You'll just make a link in {disfmarker} Yeah . {vocalsound} Huh . Well , that's nice . There's one way to uh {disfmarker} Is it {disfmarker} 'Kay , double-click it . Maybe if if you're not using the eraser {disfmarker} Here . oh . Oh , sorry . You're erasing . Something else th Yeah , arrow . Yeah . Here , that . Double-click it . Okay . So you have {disfmarker} Well , it's {disfmarker} as you saw , you have a little uh {disfmarker} Oh , you can {disfmarker} Yeah , thank you . You can go uh Yeah , okay . there . So there the the the functionality is there , but it's not it's not ideal , But {disfmarker} and it's it's very {disfmarker} {gap} . it costs a lot of time to uh To use , yeah . to use . And that's a pity , Yeah . if you uh if you have uh thirty , forty minutes uh for this kind of things , Yeah . and we are now with four people , And that's m but it {disfmarker} well , imagine you are here {disfmarker} you're with the ten people and everyone uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} That's mostly the case , from the {disfmarker} over here with the managements you get two minutes to make your case , Yeah . and if you have to do all this kind {disfmarker} Two minutes of drawing , yeah . You'll rather use PowerPoint and work it out in advance . Yep . Yeah . And th the one or two things you have to draw when you're there , just use a flip-board . Yeah . What I really miss also is uh {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} is a d is a turtle {disfmarker} {vocalsound} is a decision uh decision system like um {disfmarker} With the evaluation , you have to Polls like , what do you want , a one , a two , Yeah yeah . Yeah . maybe a a l a little application like uh uh {vocalsound} give your own number and click one two three four five six seven . Yeah , just like he said with the with the {disfmarker} a screen which you can write , also uh a kind of voting uh mechanism . Yeah , j ju ju yeah , v voting application . Oh . Yeah . Just a little group group decision application . Yeah . But uh , {gap} problem is , well you can't discuss anything {disfmarker} well you you ca uh you can , but you will discuss a lot less than l like we did now . We {disfmarker} I mean uh w w w one one person s maybe said three . Yeah . But , well uh I {disfmarker} we said {disfmarker} uh , no I w th think two , because this and this , and then you can react uh on it . Yeah , okay . But if you you put a three on it , uh just {vocalsound} figure well , everybody knows what I'm knowing , so they'll all just put a two on . Yeah , of course . But , uh you can still discuss about it , Yeah , but it would {disfmarker} {gap} yeah . but but click it in an application , that's a lot easier to process . Yeah okay , the {disfmarker} for processing part . {vocalsound} The digit . Yeah . But then uh , I think the idea of one person entering it and the rest uh discussing it , that uh isn't that bad idea , actually . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Not that your opinion isn't valued , but but still . Yeah . {vocalsound} Yeah . Okay , so {disfmarker} Okay . Okay . Yo , manager . That's it ? Uh well , just about , When are w {vocalsound} because uh {vocalsound} When are we going to produce it ? {vocalsound} Yeah , tomorrow ? Uh , the costs are within the budget . Celebration . Uh , the project is evaluated . Yeah . But , before we going to celebrate , uh I have uh a little question which you can't answer , Yeah . because uh there must be some kind of end report . I am busy with the end report right now . You might thinking what the hell was he doing uh {disfmarker} What is an end report ? Uh about all the meetings , what we have decided , a r r a report of this day . Yeah . Yeah , yeah . Uh , that must be made , but I don't know , {vocalsound} here is uh standing uh whoa , we can celebrate now , but the end report is {disfmarker} Oh , you ha you have ten minutes left , I uh read . Oh . You have now ten minutes left to finish up the end report . Okay well , that uh that can be done . Maybe we can do it uh together . You can see what I've uh {disfmarker} yeah ? Yeah . So I I s I will uh put it on a story-board . Yeah , sure . You can see it . Because I think it will uh it must be uh {disfmarker} Um {disfmarker} You you already made a beta version , or {disfmarker} Yeah , it's a three uh {gap} with seventy five uh {disfmarker} Pages . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah , just about . {vocalsound} Y yikes . {vocalsound} Seventy five pages . Well , just a moment . End report . Okay , Daniel . {vocalsound} Do you want a chair maybe ? A chairman . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} No no no , Hey ? I'm just uh {disfmarker} Oh , okay . you can s you can read it and uh {disfmarker} here here it is . End report . So you you finished it actually , and so we just have to read it and say yes or no ? Well , this not nit it {disfmarker} Yes . {vocalsound} read-only . But it's not uh fully finished yet . Five minutes for finishing . Um , this is about the functional design , the things {disfmarker} yeah yeah . Management Expert , you have to change that . Oh yeah . I'm uh {disfmarker} when I said it , I remember I had it here . Marketing . It's a read-only version . Yeah , but you can save it u the {disfmarker} under another name . Oh , okay . Marketing Expert , okay . Um about the three functions where {disfmarker} uh which are most used and uh which must uh immediately be visible on our uh remote control . Um , it must be uh simple to use , very clear what to do , and at the younger people . So , this is really about wh uh what kind things uh must be in it and uh {disfmarker} yeah . Maybe um the {disfmarker} {gap} {vocalsound} Uh {disfmarker} Yeah , I understand you , I can talk a little bit Dutch . {vocalsound} The {disfmarker} Yeah . {vocalsound} You {disfmarker} Yeah . {vocalsound} No , you have to put {disfmarker} uh , switch channels uh at the top , because that's the most used function and teletext at the second {disfmarker} Oka okay , okay , I {disfmarker} I really {vocalsound} didn't knew that . Oh nay , a volume changing , second . So , this one's first . S switch , yes . You go there and you go there . So , okay . Yeah . Okay , go on . Well , maybe I can then do it one two three . Yes , very good . One two three . If the order is in uh {disfmarker} is is uh important , Yeah . Yeah . that's the word for {gap} . The order . Uh , {vocalsound} {vocalsound} then the conceptual design . Uh , well all the things we have uh discussed , uh the energy , which uh turn out to be uh batteries , so that's {disfmarker} Yeah . Well , okay , maybe you can add it later that we decided in the end because of the cost . Yeah , because {disfmarker} yeah . Uh , he here it is still double-curve , the rubber , the flashy , the fruity , the removable . Single-curves . {vocalsound} Uh , the buttons It's not double . {disfmarker} Hmm ? A single-curved . Uh , it's not double anymore , eh ? Not double anymore . No , okay . Nay but that {disfmarker} this is what um {disfmarker} Yeah , okay . Was initial , the plan . The initial plan . Yeah . Yeah . And the the added functions like Tetris snake , it's under the parental control , the touch-screen . {vocalsound} So , it's uh just a summary of what uh we had discussed uh {disfmarker} On thing uh {disfmarker} One small thing uh , the added functions . Uh , was it included in the cost ? I don't think so , eh ? Ah , it's very cheap . Uh , it's very cheap , It's very cheap . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} you you maybe you you you you come at uh {disfmarker} No , it's it's not very cheap , but that {disfmarker} It's very necessary . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} no , but it's a development inside corporation . Like , uh w we don't have to buy parental control . Our own people can make that , I think . Yeah , but it still has some {disfmarker} Yeah . Yeah , it it has some cost , but {disfmarker} yeah . Okay , but so we can discuss that uh He'll do it in his free time . So uh {disfmarker} we can discuss that kind of things I think with the with the the board of uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Yeah . Of directur or directors . What's it what's the company called ? I just keep forgetting it . Real Reaction . Real Real Reaction . {vocalsound} {gap} {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} Real Reaction , yeah . You can ask your personal {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Okay , so uh anybody uh misses something here about uh {disfmarker} Yeah , the end conclusion . Yeah , okay , But uh {disfmarker} that's that's what I'm gonna write b between now . Okay . Still the end conclusion . That's all , I think . But , i in here nothing uh {disfmarker} Um , the decision to make um the buttons on the top , and the menu on the Mm-hmm . {vocalsound} Yes . on the bottom . And clearly {disfmarker} Yeah , touch-screen you've mentioned . Yeah , touch-screen I've mentioned . Yeah , but but the the decisions are put in the uh conclusion , I think . Okay . Why we decided to use a flat uh L_C_D_ . Okay , this n yeah . Yeah , okay , well I gonna redesign uh something now . No . Yeah . Um {disfmarker} Party party {gap} . Because I think it will {disfmarker} Oh , five minutes from {disfmarker} to finish meeting . Oh , before you change anything maybe you um save it first . Save it . You can't {disfmarker} {gap} Hmm . you can select file and export and then those J_ PEG files . Yeah , but then you had the same thing . Well , eight . And we have uh , {gap} another blank one . Example of children remote . Did we change anything ? {vocalsound} Oh wait . Wait . {vocalsound} Wow . {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} It's a new uh {vocalsound} commercial logo . Hmm . That's a pity . Don't save it , aye ? {vocalsound} Oh , that's cool , Tim . Finish meeting now . Uh , Well , I'm I'm why are only the first five SMARTboard files I'm going to finish my end report . saved ? Okay , um hereby is {disfmarker} the meeting is finished . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} You declare . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} I am the one who can say that . Yeah ? Hereby the meeting is finished . Yeah .",
        "summarize": "The group mainly talked about the interface design and price setting of the product. Firstly, the user interface designer gave a presentation on the prototype of the product. They provided the prototypes with a lot of details on the appearances and those details were then further discussed by the group.After that, the marketing expert used a seven-point scale to evaluate the prototype according to the past user requirements and trends analysis. They Cleared some misconceptions and reached a consensus on the targeting group and how they could adapt the product better to suit their needs. Then they discussed the price setting of the product and how many functions needed to be retained or removed. As they were trying very hard to remain the price at twelve and a half Euro, they squabbled over the plus and minus of the functions. In the end, they finalized on the costs and planned a celebration for the closing down of the project."

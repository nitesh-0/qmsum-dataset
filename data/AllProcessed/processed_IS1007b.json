        "transcript": "So we come again for the the second meeting . Mm-hmm . Uh for the aim of this meeting now is to to make presentation about uh the work for each one . {vocalsound} And {gap} take the the decision about the the design and the functionality of the the remote control . Okay . {vocalsound} And we have {disfmarker} think I got a new project requirement . Okay . So I think uh teletext becomes outdated . So the popularity of the {disfmarker} since the popularity of the internet , Okay . and I think we don't need lighting adaptive , so the remote control should be only used for the the television . And of course we should have our image {gap} in the in the design . So , let's start with the the industrial designer . {vocalsound} {gap} . {vocalsound} Yeah , alright . Or y you can use the whiteboard if you want . So uh {disfmarker} Well I have a PowerPoint pr presentation stored in my in my personal folder Here . so I I I think you can reach it from here . Just go to explorer . Oh okay . Or open . Participant two . Participant two . This one . Yeah . Open uh . Uh open . {vocalsound} Do you want to open {disfmarker} Because it's open you mean . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Right , so um I will talk about the the w working design and {disfmarker} {vocalsound} F_ five . Slide show , view slide show , {gap} . Ah . And um well I I will present my my first idea on how to build the {disfmarker} our new remote control for television . {vocalsound} So uh can you go one page down , please . So I think the first things to do is to define the hardware components neededs to achieve uh what we want to do . {vocalsound} So uh mm I'm thin uh {vocalsound} I think uh I I'll do a survey about what is uh what is available on the market and what what is the the cheapest possible {vocalsound} things we hav we can use . Then uh I will try with the technical team to to build a prototype and to see uh with uh h how this little box {vocalsound} would uh look look like . {vocalsound} And how an and we can uh start troubleshooting first uh com communication problems or things like that . {vocalsound} And when we are ready with this first prototype I I think we can add some software functionalities on a programmable chip like browsing by content or um things like that . Okay so can you go down uh {disfmarker} So , wha what I think {vocalsound} for now {vocalsound} is {vocalsound} we don't want to have a remote control w which is wired {vocalsound} {vocalsound} so uh I think we u we can use a battery for the {gap} . Then two programmable chips for both software functionalities and communication . And the communication with the T_V_ set is uh made through uh infrared communication So uh this is the {vocalsound} the schema of the {vocalsound} o of the future uh remote controls Did you draw it ? {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Wow . {vocalsound} so uh you can you can see the components , uh battery and uh the two chips goes to the infrared uh connection to the T_V_ set . This {gap} . This {disfmarker} What is the other chip for ? The one on top . The one on top is for the um {disfmarker} well the functionali the functionalities {vocalsound} One is a communication . and the the th red um {disfmarker} sorry the green one is is to {disfmarker} well , putting things together , um f transform the data into uh qu into the format to to {gap} uh to communicate with the T_V_ set . For men . To the {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Okay . And , that's it . I think we should use a F_P_G_A_ for {vocalsound} for the functionalities which is easy to to t Mm . What is F_P_G_A_ ? It's field programmable uh something array . {vocalsound} Gateway arrays . {vocalsound} Yeah . It's a field programmable gateway arrays . So why's it {disfmarker} how is it different from the Bluetooth ? Well , uh a F_P_G_A_ is just a chip you can uh you can {gap} pr programme it uh wi with wh whatever you want . Yeah . Programme it . Yeah {gap} . Okay . And uh well the Bluetooth chip is just responsible to uh make the communication uh between uh the two devices . Yeah . {vocalsound} Uh {disfmarker} So this are the {disfmarker} they have to work together ? Or ? Do they have to work together or two separate choice {disfmarker} No . Well , th the F_P_G_A_ will produce the the data to send . Okay . Or it's something like {disfmarker} isn't hardware the first one ? And the second one is for the software . Is the is the software par alri okay . Yeah . Yeah to run th to make it run . Okay , okay . That's it . So you can control {gap} if you want , right ? Yeah {vocalsound} . No . Alright and that's it for the working design . {vocalsound} So if you have any questions ? Mm . Okay , and how about the battery power ? Uh you mean that battery would be somewhere there and the remote contro the power to the battery comes through infrared ? Uh no no no no , I think uh we have uh to to uh have uh embedded uh b batteries in in the {disfmarker} {gap} . Into the {vocalsound} yeah into the t . more compact and uh {disfmarker} okay , {gap} Yeah , yeah . {vocalsound} And uh I I don't think it will need um {vocalsound} very uh much power to make it run , so {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Mm . Mm . Yeah , yeah . Okay . Mm . You can put it on the charger when uh you when you don't need to use it . Yeah . It's a good idea . Yeah , that's right . Yeah . Having a charger rather than putting the battery cells always . Yeah , yeah . Yeah . People don't like it to have to buy the batteries when they run out . Yeah . Mm . Uh {disfmarker} mm . We just make a small charger Y yeah , yeah . and put it {disfmarker} You can i yeah . Because you are using because you are using Bluetooth , if some people have P_D_A_ they can use their P_D_A_ to control the T_V_ if they want to , right ? That's a good idea . {vocalsound} Ma Also , but but {vocalsound} I I I think uh the the goal is to sell our remote {vocalsound} control . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} I dunno . {vocalsound} Bu {vocalsound} Yeah we can change the b {gap} . Our remote , Yeah . we do not want to make it P_D_A_ . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} S {vocalsound} okay , so charger for {gap} is the {gap} . Um . {vocalsound} So is mine . It's mine . Participant one , no ? Oh . Yeah , this your {disfmarker} Mm . Oh we have {gap} so let's move to to user interface design {gap} . Yeah . {vocalsound} So you can open uh {vocalsound} Participant {disfmarker} three . Yeah . {vocalsound} So {disfmarker} So I'm working on the technical functions design . {gap} can you show the next slide . So the the purpose is to to find uh the important questions to ask is what effect should the apparatus have . So {vocalsound} so I found on a webs on the internet {vocalsound} During the weekend . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {disfmarker} yeah . {vocalsound} I spent a lot of time searching {vocalsound} {vocalsound} That's good . {vocalsound} and uh and I found that uh the function of remote control is to send messages to television set . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Mm-hmm . {vocalsound} For example switch on , switch off , switch the next channel and so on and so on . G So I found two very good prototypes for {vocalsound} for this interface from our competitors {vocalsound} so can you {vocalsound} {disfmarker} {vocalsound} This are usual functionality {gap} . Yeah , yeah , yeah . Ours is a bit uh different . So these are two example . One is from {vocalsound} {gap} the other one is from , yeah , uh engineering centr yeah . Tasks . {vocalsound} This is the most competing prototypes I've found {vocalsound} . {vocalsound} But then uh loo but then I found if you look at {disfmarker} you see on the left one there are too many buttons {disfmarker} {vocalsound} And they are small {gap} . Yeah . O on the right I tried to play with {vocalsound} the problem is that uh if I have hundred channels I have uh I have to choo press the other button to choose the hundred channels and I have to compose the number {vocalsound} Yeah . so it's very lousy . Mm-hmm . {vocalsound} So you {vocalsound} so you move to the next the next one . Of course . Yeah , so I talk about the problem . And then I I look at the user manual they are a hundred pages thick , so we don't want that . Yeah . {vocalsound} So I propose the easy to use uh prototype . You can navigate on T_V_ screen and we can {gap} the user's preference and we need to have the T_V_ connected to internet so we end {disfmarker} in order to access the T_V_ programmes by X_M_L_ and we need some {disfmarker} to do some preprocessing . From the technical aspect , the processing should be done on the T_V_ set than on the {vocalsound} on the remote controller , right ? {vocalsound} {vocalsound} And then we {disfmarker} the speech recognition as uh Harry says we may just put in {disfmarker} we may K_I_V_ . What do you mean by the pa pa processing will be done on the T_V_ Yeah , all the processing is done {disfmarker} the T_V_ is a compu has some processing power the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} than the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} So we have to t So we should have specific T_V_ ? Or ? We can use this . Yeah . We have to sell a T_V_ with the remote control too . {vocalsound} Yeah , we don't {vocalsound} {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah because {disfmarker} {vocalsound} are you just wondering what controller {disfmarker} okay . Yeah , I think so . J j just the remote control . Yeah , not the T_V_s . I think there there is there is al there there is a a technology like show view who is already available on most of the T_V_ set on recorders or thing like that Yeah . and we can try t to get this information on to the remote control to to do the processing on the remote control because {disfmarker} Okay . Yeah . Yeah . {vocalsound} Okay . Yeah , that's right . Mm . So i the processing on on the remote controller {disfmarker} Yeah , so it can u be used in any T_V_ , any conventional T_V_ sets ? we {gap} . Yeah . Mm . Okay . {vocalsound} Speech recognition . N yeah , that's all . The next one ? So I come up with a simple design , just keep the v navigation buttons . {vocalsound} Yes , that's a good idea , I think . Keep the navigation We d we don't we we don't need really much buttons to {disfmarker} i if we have a screen to navigate on on the T_V_ so uh {vocalsound} {disfmarker} but {disfmarker} Yeah . {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} Well , f four five buttons , it's sufficient . Yeah . Mm . It's easy to build , {vocalsound} {vocalsound} it does not consume much power . {vocalsound} Yeah , that's right . {gap} . {vocalsound} Okay , that's all . {vocalsound} Oh , but you have a catch there , um assume that um if you want to go to {disfmarker} if you are watching channel two and if you want to go to channel ninety nine , then {vocalsound} . {vocalsound} Well , then y you you go to the main menu and uh you have uh go to channel Mm . and then uh you {gap} can {disfmarker} Mm . No , because you choose by channel , so {disfmarker} you choose by T_V_ program Yeah . Uh-huh huh huh huh . Maybe you {disfmarker} so you don't have hundred channels to choose from . If you go by channel , you don't have to do that . {gap} . Mm-hmm hmm hmm . {gap} but uh I I think i i {gap} if you if you want to to make uh {disfmarker} well a a big jump {vocalsound} {gap} but uh well you you have to to have a a a device when you could you could {disfmarker} But {disfmarker} So you are {disfmarker} Ah . Ah , a big jump . Yeah then yeah that's right . A mouse or {disfmarker} Well , not a mouse but uh something that that says more clearly that uh right , left , up , down , Yeah . well , the to have the ability to to to write something to the navigator , maybe directly , or {disfmarker} Mm hmm hmm . Okay . Mm . So , Okay . Mm . {vocalsound} we can think of buttons like in the telephone to send messages or things like that . Mm-hmm . How the {gap} this remote ? But we'll see . {vocalsound} Uh it's gonna be small . {vocalsound} Yeah , of course {vocalsound} small . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah . So it'll beep if you wanna find it {vocalsound} {gap} too small that it goes under the sofa and we can't find it . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} you just uh shout {disfmarker} y h just {disfmarker} it just has to re respond to you when you look for the device . Yeah , {vocalsound} that's {gap} . {vocalsound} I dunno how bu {vocalsound} {gap} just {gap} give it a name and we call him . {vocalsound} And {gap} responds to you , and {gap} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah , that's right . Yeah , that's right . Okay , so uh next presentation {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Participant four . So Harry . Okay , after having the inputs from {vocalsound} industrial design and user interface , I think most of the points which I want to are already covered here . Mm . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} And to find the most interesting features what the users would be interested , then what we have done is we have put a feedback forms in all the magazines , and the users send the feedbacks , and based on that {disfmarker} These are the findings which we got and {disfmarker} yeah adding of a speech interface is always good for a T_V_ remote but the technology {disfmarker} We already know that {disfmarker} as discussed earlier {disfmarker} Well I I think it will be a , yes , a bit complicated to um make a speech recognisers runs on the small uh ts {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} An {vocalsound} it does {gap} how feasible it is . I- {vocalsound} mm . But I think if you {gap} to recognise numbers it's a well-studied problem . I if you just recognise uh numbers is a limited {disfmarker} you have limited vocabulary {disfmarker} Oh we can put an limited vocabulary as in the mobile phones . Yeah . We just have the {disfmarker} Mm . And this can allow to choose the the program , for instance without uh adding uh buttons Yeah . so it's a good idea . {gap} it's not going to take much space also . It's going to be very slim . Mm . Mm . And next one was the size of the remote control . It has to be of course a very slim and small one . And of course most of the people are interested in if it's less expensive , Mm-hmm . Mm . so this is an important criteria here is {disfmarker} {vocalsound} But {disfmarker} {vocalsound} But do you think what they sug suggested s possibility {gap} . {vocalsound} Mm . I mean we have to look for a trade-off . Yeah . The features and the cost . {vocalsound} I no {disfmarker} I I think that uh i if we go for quality people may tolerate for high quality and of course comes with uh reasonable cost . {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Maybe not less , but they may be willing to pay little bit more for comfort , Little bit more if it's with extra features . It {disfmarker} Yeah . Yeah . yeah , extra features . Yeah , s s speech is a important extra feature I think {disfmarker} Okay . Mm . {vocalsound} Yeah . Yeah , yeah . That's right . But is it useful or not u I don't know . Well , uh {vocalsound} {disfmarker} There is {gap} in the {vocalsound} {disfmarker} I mean , for a lazy guys they could say nine and the nine channel comes . Mm . {vocalsound} Or they say movie name {disfmarker} or I don't go for movie names but only for the numbers on the channel , or volume up , volume down , brightness , contrast . Mm . Mm . Mm . So , I think this should be a good idea , to put this features . And the fourth one was the teletext in various languages . we we just have to find a mean how to to add a m a a a microphone or uh well {disfmarker} yes a microphone into the the remote control , so {disfmarker} Mm , I think {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I {disfmarker} well {disfmarker} I think i {vocalsound} it will be alright . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} If it's necessary can {disfmarker} you can do that . What is the teletext ? Mm . We can integrate small microphone in the remote Yeah . so it's not really a problem . Okay . What about lighting adaptive options ? Yeah as discussed in the earlier meeting , but {vocalsound} I think uh not much people are really interested in this point if it's not really required . According to the re to the new requirements I think we don't need that . Yeah . It is interesting but we are only concerned with the remote controller . Mm . So you need s special T_V_ sets to do that ? Or it's it's done via this remote controller ? It's very complex . I mean {disfmarker} Yeah , I think it's a bit complex too {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I mean {disfmarker} yeah , it's for the um industrial design and users interface designers to decide if it's going to be working or not . Mm . For our next product , our new T_V_ set with uh automatical uh sound adjustment {vocalsound} light {gap} {disfmarker} I think {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Yeah , then we can conclude that . Yeah . Yeah , but it's quite possible but maybe not in this project . So we have {disfmarker} I think we have s still we have couple of minutes . Mm-mm . {vocalsound} So any things to to discuss ? Or any suggestions ? {vocalsound} I think as I discussed th that four points would be good for um marketing . {vocalsound} The speech interface and uh less uh reasonable uh cost . Expensive . Price . Mm . And the lighting adaptation Mm . and the teletext . And regarding the teletext uh these are the subtitl these are the text information which you got on the televisions . {vocalsound} Okay . If you are watching an foreign movie , you get {gap} subtitles sometimes . Yeah . {vocalsound} Okay . And uh if you are a French guy watching an English movie you would like to have it in French . Mm . {gap} . And if I am a German then I would like to have the {disfmarker} my options in German . {vocalsound} So , the remote {disfmarker} it should have some {disfmarker} it should give me some flexibility of choosing the ch languages . Function . That should be a good uh point . Yeah , but well what about the the new project's requirement ? I I I think we should give up with teletext , no ? I think we we can we {disfmarker} {gap} is the {gap} . Yes . Well , so maybe we we can j we can already think uh {vocalsound} about a way to to access the internet via the television . Mm . Because if {disfmarker} Using the T_V_ to access the internet ? Or what ? I didn't quite understand {disfmarker} Yeah , but uh we can think that in a few years there will be T_V_ set that can access the internet . Yeah . Yeah , okay . So it's a good idea if i i if we i if if we uh think about how to to to build up our remote uh control w with this functionality in a {disfmarker} w which will c which will come in a few years . We already have some {gap} . So if we already have it in our remote control {disfmarker} So you have to anticipate the the future ? Yeah . {vocalsound} Yeah . Yeah . {vocalsound} The future demand , market demand . {vocalsound} Yeah , to desi {vocalsound} Yeah , that's right . well , not not to implement it , but to {disfmarker} well , to find a way to to add to add this functionality in a {disfmarker} yeah , in an in an easy manner , if is possible . {vocalsound} {gap} . The functionality in the future . In future . Alright . Yeah . Because all the T_V_ sets will be digital , right . All the programmes , everything will be in digital than analog . Th the system will change and we have to anticipate for those change . {vocalsound} Yeah , yeah . Yeah , {gap} . Okay . So {disfmarker} Okay . So let's go for the the lunch break , and we will meet after . Okay , thank you . Okay . Thank you . Okay , thank you .",
        "summarize": "In the discussion, team members did presentations and talked about the design of the remote control. Project Manager introduced the aim of the second meeting and new project requirement. Project Manager said that the team did not need to pay attention to teletext and lighting adaptive. Then Industrial Designer, User Interface and Marketing gave presentations respectively. Industrial Designer proposed that they could add software functionalities on programmable chips and could use the FPGA. User Interface focused on reducing the number of buttons and recommended navigation buttons. Marketing discussed a lot of ideas including using a speech recogniser, the size of the remote control and lighting adaptive options. In the end they discussed some topics like teletext and accessing the Internet."

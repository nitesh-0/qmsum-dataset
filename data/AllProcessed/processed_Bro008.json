        "transcript": "OK . So , uh You can fill those out , uh {pause} after , actually , so So , I got , uh {pause} these results from , uh , Stephane . Also , um , I think that , uh {pause} um {pause} we might hear later today , about other results . I think s that , uh , there were some other very good results that we 're gonna wanna compare to . But , {vocalsound} r our results from other {disfmarker} other places , yeah . I I 'm sorry ? I didn't Um , I got this from you Yeah . and then I sent a note to Sunil about the {disfmarker} cuz he has been running some other systems Mm - hmm . other than the {disfmarker} the ICSI OGI one . Oh yeah . So {pause} um , I wan wanna {disfmarker} wanna see what that is . But , uh , you know , so we 'll see what it is comparatively later . But {pause} it looks like , um M yeah . You know most of the time , even {disfmarker} I mean even though it 's true that the overall number for Danish {disfmarker} we didn't improve it If you look at it individually , what it really says is that there 's , um , uh Looks like out of the six cases , between the different kinds of , uh , matching conditions {pause} out of the six cases , there 's basically , um , a couple where it stays about the same , uh , three where it gets better , and one where it gets worse . Yeah . Uh , go ahead . Y Actually , uh , um , for the Danish , there 's still some kind of mystery because , um , um , when we use the straight features , we are not able to get these nice number with the ICSI OGI one , I mean . We don't have this ninety - three seventy - eight , we have eight Eighty - nine forty - four . yeah . Uh , so , uh , that 's probably something wrong with the features that we get from OGI . Uh , and Sunil is working on {disfmarker} on trying to {disfmarker} to check everything . Oh , and {disfmarker} and we have a little time on that {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} actually so Hmm ? We have a little bit of time on that , actually . Yeah . We have a day or so , so When {disfmarker} when {disfmarker} when do you folks leave ? Uh , Sunday . Sunday ? So So , uh Yeah , until Saturday midnight , or something , we have W we {disfmarker} we have time , yeah . Well , that would be good . That 'd be good . Yeah . Yeah . Uh , and , you know , i u when whenever anybody figures it out they should also , for sure , email Hynek because Hynek will be over there {vocalsound} telling people {vocalsound} what we did , so he should know . Mmm . Yeah . Good , OK . So , um So , we 'll {disfmarker} we 'll hold off on that a little bit . I mean , even with these results as they are , it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's really not that bad . But {disfmarker} but , uh , um And it looks like the overall result as they are now , even without , you know , any {disfmarker} any bugs being fixed is that , uh , on the {disfmarker} the other tasks , we had this average of , uh , forty uh {disfmarker} nine percent , or so , improvement . And here we have somewhat better than that than the Danish , and somewhat worse than that on the German , but I mean , it sounds like , uh , one way or another , the methods that we 're doing can reduce the error rate from {disfmarker} from mel ceptrum {pause} down by , you know {pause} a fourth of them to , uh , a half of them . Somewhere in there , depending on the {pause} exact case . So So that 's good . I mean , I think that , uh , one of the things that Hynek was talking about was understanding what was in the other really good proposals and {disfmarker} and trying to see if what should ultimately be proposed is some , uh , combination of things . Um , if , uh {disfmarker} Cuz there 's things that they are doing {pause} there that we certainly are not doing . And there 's things that we 're doing that {pause} they 're not doing . And {disfmarker} and they all seem like good things . Yeah . So Mmm , yeah . How much {disfmarker} how much better was the best system than ours ? So Well , we don't know yet . Mmm . Uh , I mean , first place , there 's still this thing to {disfmarker} to work out , and second place {disfmarker} second thing is that the only results that we have so far from before were really development set results . Oh , OK . So , I think in this community that 's of interest . It 's not like everything is being pinned on the evaluation set . But , um , for the development set , our best result was a little bit short of fifty percent . And the best result of any system was about fifty - four , where these numbers are the , uh , relative , uh , reduction in , uh , word error rate . Oh , OK . And , um , the other systems were , uh , somewhat lower than that . There was actually {disfmarker} there was much less of a huge range than there was in Aurora one . In Aurora one there were {disfmarker} there were systems that ba basically didn't improve things . Hmm . And here the {disfmarker} the worst system {pause} still reduced the error rate by thirty - three percent , or something , in development set . Oh , wow . So {disfmarker} so , you know , sort of everybody is doing things between , well , roughly a third of the errors , and half the errors being eliminated , {vocalsound} uh , and varying on different test sets and so forth . Mm - hmm . So I think Um {pause} It 's probably a good time to look at what 's really going on and seeing if there 's a {disfmarker} there 's a way to combine the best ideas while at the same time not blowing up the amount of , uh , resources used , cuz that 's {disfmarker} that 's critical for this {disfmarker} this test . Do we know anything about {disfmarker} who {disfmarker} who 's was it that had the lowest on the dev set ? Um , uh , the , uh , the there were two systems that were put forth by a combination of {disfmarker} of , uh , French Telecom and Alcatel . And , um they {disfmarker} they differed in some respects , but they e em one was called the French Telecom Alcatel System the other was called the Alcatel French Telecom System , {vocalsound} uh , which is the biggest difference , I think . But {disfmarker} but there 're {disfmarker} there 're {disfmarker} there 're some other differences , too . Uh , and {disfmarker} and , uh , they both did very well , Uh - huh . you know ? So , {vocalsound} um , my impression is they also did very well on {disfmarker} on the {disfmarker} the , uh , evaluation set , but , um , I {disfmarker} I we haven't seen {disfmarker} you 've - you haven't seen any final results for that And they used {disfmarker} the main thing that {disfmarker} that they used was spectral subtraction ? yeah . Or There is a couple pieces to it . There 's a spectral subtraction style piece {disfmarker} it was basically , you know , Wiener filtering . And then {disfmarker} then there was some p some modification of the cepstral parameters , where they {disfmarker} Yeah , actually , something that 's close to cepstral mean subtraction . But , uh , the way the mean is adapted {disfmarker} um , it 's signal dependent . I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm , uh So , basically , the mean is adapted during speech and not during silence . Yeah . But it 's very close to {disfmarker} to cepstral mean subtraction . But some people have done {vocalsound} {pause} exactly that sort of thing , of {disfmarker} of {disfmarker} and the {disfmarker} I mean it 's not {disfmarker} To {disfmarker} to look in {pause} speech only , to try to m to measure these things during speech , Yeah , yeah . that 's p that 's not that uncommon . But i it it {disfmarker} so it looks like they did some {disfmarker} some , uh , reasonable things , uh , and they 're not things that we did , precisely . We did unreasonable things , {vocalsound} which {disfmarker} because we like to try strange things , and {disfmarker} and , uh , and our things worked too . Hmm . And so , um , uh , it 's possible that some combination of these different things that were done would be the best thing to do . But the only caveat to that is that everybody 's being real conscious of how much memory and how much CPU they 're using Mm - hmm . because these , {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} uh , standards are supposed to go on cell phones with m moderate resources in both respects . Did anybody , uh , do anything with the models as a {disfmarker} an experiment ? Or Uh , they didn't report it , if they did . N nobody reported it ? Yeah . I think everybody was focused elsewhere . Um , now , one of the things that 's nice about what we did is , we do have a {disfmarker} a , uh {disfmarker} a filtering , which leads to a {disfmarker} a , uh {disfmarker} a reduction in the bandwidth in the modulation spectrum , which allows us to downsample . So , uh , as a result of that we have a reduced , um , transmission rate for the bits . Mm - hmm . That was misreported the first time out . It {disfmarker} it said the same amount because for convenience sake in the particular way that this is being tested , uh , they were repeating the packets . So it was {disfmarker} they were s they {disfmarker} they had twenty - four hundred bits per second , but they were literally creating forty - eight hundred bits per second , {vocalsound} um , even though y it was just repeated . Oh . Mm - hmm . Right . So , uh , in practice So you could 've had a repeat count in there or something . Well , n I mean , this was just a ph phoney thing just to {disfmarker} to fit into the {disfmarker} the software that was testing the errors {disfmarker} channel errors and so on . Oh . Oh . So {disfmarker} so in reality , if you put this {disfmarker} this system in into , uh , the field , it would be twenty - four hundred bits per second , not forty - eight hundred . So , um , so that 's a nice feature of what {disfmarker} what we did . Um , but , um , well , we still have to see how it all comes out . Hmm . Um , and then there 's the whole standards process , which is another thing altogether . When is the development set {disfmarker} I mean , the , uh , uh , test set results due ? Like the day before you leave or something ? Uh , probably the day after they leave , but we 'll have to {disfmarker} {vocalsound} we 'll have to stop it the day before {comment} we leave . Yeah , yeah . So Huh . I think tha I think the {disfmarker} the meeting is on the thirteenth or something . Yeah , this Tuesday , yeah . And , uh , they , uh Right . And the {disfmarker} the , uh , results are due like the day before the meeting or something . So Yeah , probably , well I th I think {disfmarker} I I think they are , Yeah , well yeah . So {pause} {vocalsound} um , since we have a bit farther to travel than {vocalsound} some of the others , {vocalsound} uh , we 'll have to get done a little quicker . But , um , I mean , it 's just tracing down these bugs . I mean , just exactly this sort of thing of , you know , why {disfmarker} why these features seem to be behaving differently , uh , in California than in Oregon .  Hmm . Might have something to do with electricity shortage . Uh , we didn't {disfmarker} we didn't have enough electrons here and Uh , but , um Uh , I think , you know , the main reason for having {disfmarker} I mean , it only takes w to run the {disfmarker} the two test sets in {disfmarker} just in computer time is just a day or so , right ? Yeah , So it 's very short interval . yeah . So , I think the who the whole reason for having as long as we have , which was {pause} like a week and a half , is {disfmarker} is because of bugs like that . So Huh So , we 're gonna end up with these same kind of sheets that have the {pause} the percentages and so on just for the {disfmarker} Yeah , so there are two more columns in the sheets , Oh , I guess it 's the same sheets , two . Yeah , it 's the same sheets , yeah , yeah {disfmarker} yeah . just with the missing columns filled in . Yeah . Yeah . Well , that 'll be good . So , I 'll dis I 'll disregard these numbers . That 's {disfmarker} that 's {disfmarker} that 's good . So , Hynek will try to push for trying to combine , uh , different things ? Or Hmm ? Uh , well that 's {pause} um yeah I mean , I think the question is \" Is there {disfmarker} is there some advantage ? \" I mean , you could just take the best system and say that 's the standard . But the thing is that if different systems are getting at good things , um , a again within the constraint of the resources , if there 's something simple that you can do Now for instance , uh , it 's , I think , very reasonable to have a standard for the terminal 's side and then for the server 's side say , \" Here 's a number of things that could be done . \" So , um , everything that we did could probably just be added on to what Alcatel did , and i it 'd probably work pretty well with them , too . So , um , uh , that 's one {disfmarker} one aspect of it . And then on the terminal 's side , I don't know how much , um , memory and {disfmarker} and CPU it takes , but it seems like the filtering {pause} Uh , I mean , the VAD stuff they both had , right ? And , um , so {disfmarker} and they both had some kind of on - line normalization , right ? Uh , yeah . Of sorts , yeah ? So {disfmarker} so , it seems like the main different there is the {disfmarker} is the , uh , filtering . And the filtering {disfmarker} I think if you can {disfmarker} shouldn't take a lot of memory to do that Uh , and I also wouldn't think the CPU , uh , would be much either for that part . So , if you can {disfmarker} if you can add those in {pause} um {pause} then , uh , you can cut the data rate in half . Yeah . So it seems like the right thing to do is to {disfmarker} on the {disfmarker} on the terminal 's side , take what they did , if it {disfmarker} if it does seem to generalize well to German and Danish , uh , take what they did add in a filter , and add in some stuff on the server 's side and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and that 's probably a reasonable standard . Um {pause} Uh They are working on this already ? Because {disfmarker} yeah , Su - Sunil told me that he was trying already to put some kind of , uh , filtering in the {vocalsound} {pause} France Telecom . Yeah , so that 's {disfmarker} that 's {disfmarker} that 's what That would be ideal {disfmarker} would be is that they could , you know , they could actually show that , in fact , a combination of some sort , {vocalsound} uh , would work even better than what {disfmarker} what any of the systems had . And , um , then it would {disfmarker} it would , uh {pause} be something to {disfmarker} to discuss in the meeting . But , uh , not clear what will go on . Um , I mean , on the one hand , um , sometimes people are just anxious to get a standard out there . I mean , you can always have another standard after that , but {vocalsound} this process has gone on for a while on {disfmarker} already and {disfmarker} and people might just wanna pick something and say , \" OK , this is it . \" And then , that 's a standard . Uh , standards are always optional . It 's just that , uh , if you disobey them , then you risk not being able to sell your product , or {pause} {vocalsound} Uh {pause} um And people often work on new standards while an old standard is in place and so on . So it 's not final even if they declared a standard . The other hand , they might just say they just don't know enough yet to {disfmarker} to declare a standard . So you {disfmarker} you {disfmarker} you will be {disfmarker} you will become experts on this and know more {disfmarker} far more than me about the tha this particular standards process once you {disfmarker} you go to this meeting . So , be interested in hearing . So , uh , I 'd be , uh , interested in hearing , uh , your thoughts now I mean you 're almost done . I mean , you 're done in the sense that , um , you may be able to get some new features from Sunil , and we 'll re - run it . Uh , but other than that , you 're {disfmarker} you 're basically done , right ? So , uh , I 'm interested in hearing {disfmarker} hearing your thoughts about {pause} where you think we should go from this . Yeah . I mean , we tried a lot of things in a hurry , and , uh , if we can back off from this now and sort of take our time with something , and not have doing things quickly be quite so much the constraint , what {disfmarker} what you think would be the best thing to do . Uh , well Hmm Well , first , uh , to really have a look at {disfmarker} at the speech {pause} {vocalsound} from these databases because , well , we tried several thing , but we did not really look {vocalsound} at what what 's happening , and {vocalsound} where is the noise , and OK . Eh It 's a novel idea . Look at the data . OK . Yeah . Or more generally , I guess , what {disfmarker} what is causing the degradation . Yeah , yeah . Actually , there is one thing that {disfmarker} well {pause} Um , generally we {disfmarker} we think that {vocalsound} most of the errors are within phoneme classes , and so I think it could be interesting to {disfmarker} to see if it {disfmarker} I don't think it 's still true when we add noise , and {vocalsound} so we have {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I guess the confusion ma the confusion matrices are very different when {disfmarker} when we have noise , and when it 's clean speech . And probably , there is much more {pause} between classes errors for noisy speech . Mm - hmm . And {vocalsound} so , um Yeah , so perhaps we could have a {disfmarker} a large gain , eh , just by looking at improving the , uh , recognition , not of phonemes , but of phoneme classes , simply . Mm - hmm . And {vocalsound} which is a s a s a simpler problem , perhaps , but {disfmarker} which is perhaps important for noisy speech . The other thing that strikes me , just looking at these numbers is , just taking the best cases , I mean , some of these , of course , even with all of our {disfmarker} our wonderful processing , still are horrible kinds of numbers . But just take the best case , the well - matched {pause} uh , German case after {disfmarker} er well - matched Danish after we {disfmarker} Mm - hmm . the kind of numbers we 're getting are about eight or nine {pause} uh {pause} p percent {pause} error {pause} per digit . Mm - hmm . Yeah . This is obviously not usable , No . right ? Sure . I mean , if you have ten digits for a phone number {comment} I mean , every now and then you 'll get it right . I mean , it 's {disfmarker} it 's , uh , {vocalsound} um So , I mean , the other thing is that , uh {disfmarker} And {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} a and {disfmarker} and also , um {pause} part of what 's nice about this is that this is , uh , {vocalsound} um {pause} a realistic {disfmarker} almost realistic database . I mean , it 's still not people who are really trying to accomplish something , but {disfmarker} but , uh , within the artificial setup , it isn't noise artificially added , you know , simulated , uh , additive noise . Mm - hmm . It 's real noise condition . And , um , {vocalsound} the {disfmarker} the training {disfmarker} the training , I guess , is always done on the close talking No , actually {disfmarker} actually the well - matched condition {pause} is {pause} still quite di still quite difficult . No ? I mean , it 's {disfmarker} they have all these data from the close mike and from the distant mike , {vocalsound} from different driving condition , open window , closed window , Yeah . and they take all of this and they take seventy percent , I think , for training and thirty percent for testing . Mm - hmm . So , training is done {vocalsound} on different conditions and different microphones , and testing also is done {pause} on different microphone and conditions . So , probably if we only take the close microphones , {vocalsound} I guess the results should be much much better than this . I see . Mmm . Oh , OK , Uh that explains it partially . Wha - what about i in {disfmarker} so the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} Yeah , so {disfmarker} there is this , the mismatched is , um {pause} the same kind of thing , go ahead . but {pause} the driving conditions , I mean the speed and the kind of road , is different for training and testing , is that right ? Yeah . And the last condition is close microphone for training and distant for testing . Yeah . Uh , OK , So {disfmarker} {vocalsound} s so {disfmarker} so I see . So , yeah , so the high {disfmarker} so the {disfmarker} right {disfmarker} so the highly mismatched {vocalsound} case {pause} is in some sense a good model for what we 've been , you know , typically talking about when we talk about additive noise in {disfmarker} And so {disfmarker} and i i k it does correspond to a realistic situation in the sense that , {vocalsound} um , people might really be trying to , uh , call out telephone numbers or some or something like that , in {disfmarker} in their cars Yeah . and they 're trying to connect to something . Mmm . Um Actually , yeah , it 's very close to clean speech training because , well , because the close microphone {vocalsound} and noisy speech testing , Yeah . Yeah . yeah . Mmm . Yeah . And the well - matched condition {pause} is what you might imagine that you might be able to approach , if you know that this is the application . You 're gonna record a bunch on people in cars and so forth , and do these training . And then , uh , when y you sell it to somebody , they will be a different person with a different car , and so on . So it 's {disfmarker} this is a an optim somewhat optimistic view on it , uh , so , you know , the real thing is somewhere in between the two . Yeah . Uh , uh , but But the {disfmarker} I mean , the {pause} th th Even the optimistic one is it doesn't work . Yeah , It {disfmarker} right . Right , it doesn't work . So , in a way , that 's , you know , that 's sort of the dominant thing is that even , say on the development set stuff that we saw , the , uh , the numbers that , uh , that Alcatel was getting when choosing out the best single numbers , {vocalsound} it was just {disfmarker} you know , it wasn't good enough for {disfmarker} for {pause} a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} for a real system . Mmm . Mm - hmm . You {disfmarker} you {disfmarker} you , {vocalsound} um So , uh , we still have stuff to do . Yeah . Uh , and , uh I don't know So , looking at the data , where , you know {disfmarker} what 's the {disfmarker} what 's {disfmarker} what 's th what 's characteristic i e yeah , I think that 's {disfmarker} that 's a good thing . Does a any you have any thoughts about what else {vocalsound} y you 're thinking that you didn't get to that you would like to do if you had more time ? Uh Oh , f a lot of thing . Because we trying a lot of s {pause} thing , and we doesn't work , {vocalsound} we remove these . Maybe {vocalsound} we trying again with the articulatory feature . I don't know exactly because we tried {disfmarker} we {disfmarker} some {disfmarker} one experiment that doesn't work . Um , forgot it , something {pause} I don't know exactly Mm - hmm . because , tsk {comment} {vocalsound} maybe do better some step the general , {vocalsound} eh , diagram . Mm - hmm . I don't know exactly s to think what we can improve . Yeah , cuz a lot of time it 's true , there were a lot of times when we 've tried something and it didn't work right away , even though we had an intuition that there should be something there . And so then we would just stop it . Um And , uh , one of the things {disfmarker} I don't remember the details on , but I remember at some point , when you were working with a second stream , and you tried a low - pass filtering to cepstrum , in some case you got {disfmarker} MSG Yeah . Well , but it was {comment} an MSG - like thing , but it wasn't MSG , right ? Uh , you {disfmarker} y I think in some case you got some little improvement , but it was , you know , sort of a small improvement , and it was a {disfmarker} a big added complication , so you dropped it . But , um , that was just sort of one try , right ? You just took one filter , threw it there , Yeah , right ? And it seems to me that , um , if that is an important idea , which , you know , might be , that one could work at it for a while , as you 're saying . Hmm . And , uh Uh , and you had , you know , you had the multi - band things also , and , you know , there was issue of that . Yeah , Um , Barry 's going to be , uh , continuing working on multi - band things as well . Mm - hmm . We were just talking about , um , {vocalsound} some , uh , some work that we 're interested in . Kind of inspired by the stuff by Larry Saul with the , uh {pause} uh , learning articulatory feature in {disfmarker} I think , in the case of his paper {disfmarker} with sonorance based on , uh , multi - band information where you have a {disfmarker} a combination of gradient learning an and , uh , EM . Mm - hmm . Um , and {pause} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Um , so , I think that , you know , this is a , uh {disfmarker} this is a neat data set . Um , and then , uh , as we mentioned before , we also have the {disfmarker} the new , uh , digit set coming up from recordings in this room . So , there 's a lot of things to work with . Um and , uh what I like about it , in a way , is that , uh , the results are still so terrible . Uh {pause} {vocalsound} Uh {pause} {vocalsound} I mean , they 're much better than they were , you know . We 're talking about thirty to sixty percent , uh , error rate reduction . That 's {disfmarker} that 's really great stuff to {disfmarker} to do that in relatively short time . But even after that it 's still , you know , so poor that {disfmarker} that , uh , no one could really use it . So , um I think that 's great that {disfmarker} because {disfmarker} and y also because again , it 's not something {disfmarker} sometimes we 've gotten terrible results by taking some data , and artificially , you know , convolving it with some room response , or something {disfmarker} we take a very {disfmarker} Uh , at one point , uh , Brian and I went downstairs into the {disfmarker} the basement where it was {disfmarker} it was in a hallway where it was very reverberant and we {disfmarker} we made some recordings there . And then we {vocalsound} {disfmarker} we , uh {disfmarker} uh , made a simulation of the {disfmarker} of the room acoustics there and {disfmarker} and applied it to other things , Mm - hmm . and uh But it was all pretty artificial , and {disfmarker} and , you know , how often would you really try to have your most crucial conversations in this very reverberant hallway ? Um {pause} So , uh {pause} This is what 's nice about the Aurora data and the data here , is that {disfmarker} is that it 's sort of a realistic room situation {pause} uh , acoustics {disfmarker} acoustic situation , both terms in noise and reflections , and so on and n n And , uh , uh , with something that 's still relatively realistic , it 's still very very hard to do very well . So Yeah . Yeah , so d well Actually , this is {disfmarker} tha that 's why we {disfmarker} well , it 's a different kind of data . We 're not {disfmarker} we 're not used to work with this kind of data . That 's why we should have a loo more closer look at what 's going on . Yeah . Mm - hmm . Um Yeah . So this would be the first thing , and then , of course , try to {disfmarker} well , {vocalsound} kind of debug what was wrong , eh , when we do Aurora test on the MSG {pause} particularly , and on the multi - band . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Uh Yeah . Yeah . No , I {disfmarker} I think there 's lots of {disfmarker} lots of good things to do with this . So Um So let 's {disfmarker} I guess {pause} You were gonna say something else ? Oh , OK . What do you think ? About Anything About other experiments ? Uh , now , I 'm interested in , um , uh {pause} looking at the experiments where you use , um {pause} uh , data from multiple languages to train the neural net . And I don't know how far , or if you guys even had a chance to try that , but {pause} that would be some it 'd be interesting to me . Yeah , but S b Again , it 's the kind of {disfmarker} of thing that , uh , we were thin thinking {disfmarker} thinking that it would work , but it didn't work . And , eh , so there is kind of {disfmarker} of {pause} not a bug , but something wrong in what we are doing , perhaps . Yeah . Right . Right . Uh , something wrong , perhaps in the {disfmarker} just in the {disfmarker} the fact that the labels are {disfmarker} Right . well Mm - hmm . What worked best is the hand - labeled data . Mm - hmm . Um Uh , so , yeah . I don't know if we can get some hand - labeled data from other languages . Yeah . It 's not so easy to find . Right . But {pause} that would be something interesting t to {disfmarker} to see . Yeah , yeah . Yeah . Also , uh , {vocalsound} I mean , there was just the whole notion of having multiple nets that were trained on different data . So one form of different data was {disfmarker} is from different languages , but the other Well , i in fact , uh , m in those experiments it wasn't so much combining multiple nets , it was a single net that had different Yeah . So , first thing is would it be better if they were multiple nets , for some reason ? Second thing is , never mind the different languages , just having acoustic conditions rather than training them all up in one , would it be helpful to have different ones ? So , um That was a question that was kind of raised by Mike Shire 's thesis , and on {disfmarker} in that case in terms of reverberation . Right ? That {disfmarker} that sometimes it might be better to do that . But , um , {vocalsound} I don't think we know for sure . So , um Right .

        "transcript": "{gap} . Hello {vocalsound} . 'Kay . You all saw the newsflash ? It's {disfmarker} Or you got the same message ? Yeah I I just saw it one minute ago . {vocalsound} Yeah sorry . I don't know . When I uh {disfmarker} I didn't see it yet I think . Newsflash ? D did I miss something ? {vocalsound} Yeah . Yeah . Yeah I received an email so I thought I I can't mail you so I thought I'd just drop it in the folder , but {disfmarker} Yeah pretty much . Hey what's wrong with my computer ? Okay . Is it unlocked ? No . {gap} . Mm . Yeah that's my presentation . {vocalsound} Woah . I uh kind of opened it {gap} . Mm . Huh ? Mm ? Uh {disfmarker} What the {disfmarker} Oh right . I think you have to uh change your desktop uh Okay . {vocalsound} size . Ooh . {vocalsound} 'Kay . Everybody ready ? Not really . Well {disfmarker} Sorry . No no no . Yes yes yes . {gap} computer is uh not functioning ? Alright . {vocalsound} Okay . Okay . Where do I find this ? I'm not so g display huh ? Uh display . {vocalsound} And then uh settings ? Appearance ? Huh . Mm I'm not sure I {gap} . {vocalsound} You read the newsflash ? {vocalsound} 'Kay . Can we get started No . No what was it about ? Hmm . or is there some pressing issue ? Yeah my computer is not functioning properly . Oh no pressing . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Did you plug in the power cable when you come back ? Yeah yeah . No but my screen is reduced in size . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah . That's difficult . Yeah . {vocalsound} What ? {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} Feedback . Hmm . Okay . {vocalsound} Okay . {gap} alt delete . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} Format . {vocalsound} Format save . {gap} . So it doesn't draw the attention away . Yeah . This is dreadful . I made uh uh my own map . Oh yeah sure . No not this , but the task . It's a {disfmarker} You have Playstation also ? Yeah . {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} No that's okay . No I just flapped it , closed it , took it here and then this happened . Ah . Uh {disfmarker} where was it ? In settings ? Okay . Alright . Thank you . Huh . Do you guys like your tasks ? Yeah . Yeah . {vocalsound} I spent a lot of time thinking about what I was gonna do and then a couple of minutes before this I get my function you know the information that I need . Yeah wa wa you actually {disfmarker} Yeah . But it it's not clear what you have to to to type uh type in your presentation . So frustrating . Yeah . So {disfmarker} Yeah . I I had a whole idea and then just was typing it and then oh . I have to do that so switch . Yeah {disfmarker} Yeah exactly . This presentation is mainly based on my own ideas 'cause I hadn't time to intergrate tha the information yet so {disfmarker} Yeah . Mm . Really annoying . Okay . So there we are again . By your humble P_M_ . Yeah . {vocalsound} Okay this is the agenda . Um we have three presentations , I heard . {vocalsound} Really . {vocalsound} Yeah really . {vocalsound} So who wants to start ? Yeah that's fine {gap} . Yeah . We have to start it right away ? {vocalsound} Yeah . Uh this is you ? Functional ? Yeah functional requirements . 'Kay . Alright . I'm gonna talk about functional requirements . Um {disfmarker} Well uh some research has be done uh has been done . Uh observing of one hundred uh subjects in the usability lab using a remote control . Uh and they also filled in a questionnaire . The findings were um , well you can see them for yourself . They disliked the look-and-feel of current remotes controls . {vocalsound} Users think they're ugly . Um {vocalsound} they do not match the the operating behaviour of the users . So they they d they don't match what they want to have on it . Um {vocalsound} they are often lost somewhere in the room . Um it takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote control . And they're bad for R_S_I_ . {vocalsound} I don't know uh how a user can reach that but okay . Um {vocalsound} Ts there is also uh was also some research on uh the most relevant and and and irrelevant uh f functions . Uh most irrelevant and less used were audio settings , mono , stereo , uh pitch , bass . Um screen settings for brightness and colour and stuff like that . Um but they are used . I mean the {disfmarker} So they do need to be in the {disfmarker} Yeah . Yeah they do need to be on the on the remote control . Alright . I mean if you can't control the the sound settings {disfmarker} I mean if you dislike a very uh loud bass or something , you you need to change that . {vocalsound} {gap} often . So um yeah we have to . By the way my T_V_ doesn't have an equ equaliser but We c we c Yeah I mean w we can't {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Next generation does . {vocalsound} {disfmarker} okay . my my T_V_ has , No . {vocalsound} Alright . but we we can leave them uh away . Uh most relevant , uh most used functions , uh they speak for themselves I guess . Uh power button , uh channel , volume selection . Uh teletext but we can skip that because I saw the newsflash , and teletext is so outdated that it it's i should not be used uh any more in the future . N not used anymore . So forget this one . Okay . Uh channel settings , so for programming uh your channels in in the right order . Yeah . By the way where did you guys get that newsflash from ? Yeah . {vocalsound} I was wondering uh {disfmarker} I didn't get anything . Yeah , {vocalsound} on on the project uh {disfmarker} Yeah . Not by mail . I receiv the mail but you don't . So {disfmarker} But you you've got more information than {disfmarker} uh . No so it's a text file n in the project folder . So teletext can be skipped . That's in the presentation , so {disfmarker} Alright . Um there was some research on new features in a remote control . Uh about an L_C_D_ screen uh and speech recognition . Well we got an update for the for the audience . Or the the the targeted group . So it's above forty I guess . Uh below I believe . The new product ? Or below {vocalsound} Yeah below forty . because that's pretty relevant . Mm-hmm . I thought I read a {disfmarker} Our current customers are in the age group forty plus . Yeah ? And the new product should reach new markets , which is the customers below forty . Below ? Okay well {vocalsound} But where did you get uh that information ? That's in a newsflash . that's that's in the newsfla {vocalsound} Okay . {vocalsound} okay that's a good to know . Um because you see see a clear distinction between the age groups , concerning the features . Yeah . I mean uh above forty people are not so interested uh not so interested in a screen or speech recognition . Uh but below that age they uh they pretty much are . So I think we can build that in . Um {disfmarker} Yeah well we can skip this part as well , because I thought I read above forty so we could skip the features , but we just have to build them in because uh they find it very interesting . Um well we have to keep all the classic functions but make the buttons as user-friendly as possible . Um and and also there's {disfmarker} so not only the design of the bus uh buttons but o how you can push them , and stuff like that . So the physical uh aspect of it . Um {disfmarker} And I think {disfmarker} and certainly for for the for the lower age groups , uh nice design , which uh does not make the remote control {gap} in your room . Yeah . It's it's actually a part of your interior , of of your design in your room . So it's {vocalsound} the people can say , well what's that , well that's my remote control , so it's d it has to look nice and feel nice , and and have all the functions that uh {disfmarker} Yeah . But it also needs to have corporate identity . Yeah so the the logo has to be Present and the colours . uh present yeah , and the colours as well . {vocalsound} So we can't change much of that . Do we have {disfmarker} uh yeah {gap} . Yeah so but I I don't think that's that's a problem because the thing has to have a colour anyway , and most of the times there is a brand present on it . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Yeah . Yeah . So I think that's not gonna gonna affect it very uh very much . Okay . Well that are the the consequences uh on a marketing uh part . {vocalsound} 'Kay . Alright . Yes . Okay . It's open already so you can use {gap} to {gap} . find yours . Mm . It's {disfmarker} F_ five . F_ five . Okay . {vocalsound} Go Jurgen . Oh . What is this ? {vocalsound} Oh no . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} How do I uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} You pressed alt F_ four ? {vocalsound} No no no . I pressed the mouse button . Oh great . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} It's {disfmarker} th that's the self-destruct button . {vocalsound} Yeah . Yeah . Okay . Uh maybe you can do it from your computer so talk us through it . Okay . Um if you all go stand around uh {disfmarker} Yeah . Just {disfmarker} yeah . Yeah . {vocalsound} Computer {disfmarker} Alright . Sure . Um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} That's nice . {vocalsound} No . F_ five . Yeah . Yeah . Okay . Alright . I uh had uh two examples . Mm-hmm . Um this one is the the yeah the advanced one with a lot of options and functions and buttons . Mm-hmm . This the easy one Yeah . I think we have to to combine them . And uh yeah merge the best functions of all examples . Mm-hmm . Yeah . Mm-hmm . Yeah . Um but yeah the the age is uh under forty ? The mm yeah . Yeah and and and marketing research stated that that that kind of users are not afraid of of a lot of functions . So we {disfmarker} Okay so so we have the option for more functions . So not not too much but {disfmarker} yeah . Um {disfmarker} yeah . And we do have to integrate the screen and the the speech {disfmarker} And the speech recognition yeah . {vocalsound} Yeah . Yeah . alright . Uh yeah this this one we can remove for kids . It's just only for adults so uh we can uh use some advanced options . But {disfmarker} Yeah from age of sixteen so yeah . Yeah but I prefer we we uh use the the basic options uh yeah . We have to to make them very easy so for just uh zapping around the channels you can just push one button . Mm . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . But if you want to to use your your video recorder or something else , you should use use an uh an advanced option . Yeah but uh the the newsflash also stated that it should control only one device , only your television . Okay one device . Yeah . So n it's very easy . Okay . I didn't see {gap} . So w Now yeah it's okay . {vocalsound} Okay and I also uh yeah . W yeah . So there are not extra options in this case , but uh {disfmarker} Okay . We have to make it fashionable . Like you uh said uh before . Yeah . Yeah . Uh yeah the basic functions . Um yeah only use a extra function if they are really needed . Yeah so maybe you can hide them or something . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah well what what we can do with the screen is is all the the configuration options , you can put that in the screen . Yeah you make a screen menu or something . And the and the {disfmarker} yeah screen menu to to to uh to do that , Yeah . Yeah . and then the basic function just on the device itself . Mm-hmm . So it looks very simple and all the advanced features are hidden in the screen , uh with a clear menu . Yeah and the other oth other uh functionality is the screen . Yeah . What does the screen do ? {vocalsound} Did I uh {disfmarker} Alright . Uh . {vocalsound} What are {disfmarker} wh Yeah . It's low power . did I break it ? {vocalsound} What {gap} . So what does the screen do ? They said they needed it but what does it do ? What do they want with the screen ? For for the advanced functions I think . Yeah that's what we make it up . Yeah well it {gap} yeah it didn't So but what did the marketing {disfmarker} it didn't say what they want to do with the screen . No . Well I , my guess is it's it's pretty handy for advanced uh advanced functions . Yeah okay it's handy . With no predefined uh {disfmarker} Like searching for channels and {disfmarker} Ah look . Yeah searching for channels , programming them . Yeah . We have your uh {disfmarker} oh never mind . {vocalsound} We're back online . {vocalsound} Okay . That's uh {disfmarker} I'm al I'm almost finished so {disfmarker} Okay . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Um the {disfmarker} we have to to to watch out for the {disfmarker} i if we make it f very fashionable , it it the functional functionality will go down . So we have to make uh a compromise between functionality and fashional fashionable Mm-hmm . Content and form . yeah content and form . {gap} . Yeah . Yeah . {vocalsound} Now that that was uh was the end . {vocalsound} That was the end . Okay . Yes . Okay . Yeah . Well my presentation is a bit uh sucky . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Well you can improvise right ? Uh which one is it ? Technical functions ? Yeah a little bit . This one ? Uh no . No no . {vocalsound} Functional requirements ? Yeah I think that would be it then . {gap} No . {vocalsound} You didn't put it in ? Or {disfmarker} I have no idea . So we we can go for {disfmarker} That w {gap} . {gap} it's not really English . {vocalsound} Let me check . I know . Uh kick off . Oh working design I got it . Yeah . So we can go for the look-and-feel of the the left example , and then a screen on top of it . Here you go . Alright how do I uh skip pages ? Just uh press uh {disfmarker} yeah . Yeah . The keys yeah ? Yeah . Alright . Um yeah well I was working on this before I got my information . So I was just working off the top of my head and using my colin common knowledge about uh remote controls . Mm-hmm . {vocalsound} And well the info on the website which came too late . Mm-hmm . Um so I didn't really know what kind of functions we had to put into it yet . Mm-hmm . So uh uh this is basically an overview of what we discussed in our last uh meeting . Those were my uh starting points . Mm-hmm . Uh I was working on a s yeah on a schedule , and I was supposed to do it like this . But um yeah then uh the information came and it was kind of exact with all the steps in the remote control that I had to follow , so I was trying to organise them for myself . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Mm . And then make the Design yeah . the design , a the actual design , Design ? Yeah . but I never came around to do that . So I'm not really sure what I'm supposed to say about it . Okay . I mean everything speaks for itself I guess . Mean you press a button um {vocalsound} the it tru goes , it sends a signal to a chip , Mm-hmm . which uh translates it into infrared signal of certin spatial frequencies . Mm-hmm . Yeah frequency . Yeah . And uh or temporal fr frequencies actually . And then uh through a uh transformer , it the signal gets boosted and then sent to the to the receiver on the T_V_ Yeah decoder . and the T_V_ will translate it into a function . Um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Yeah well this was actually {vocalsound} all I got around to do . {vocalsound} Blank . Yeah okay . {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} Yeah . I mean I dunno if I'm too slow for this stuff , but uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Work harder . {vocalsound} Okay shou should we make a list of the of all the functions we want uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Yeah . Whatever . Yeah . Uh {disfmarker} Yeah we want to incorporate in uh into it . Yeah . 'Kay . Um for those that didn't see yet um the basic new requirements of the management were no teletext , only for T_V_ . Uh it should be designed for a use g uh group below forty , but I don't think it's w wrong if we can uh target the current customer group as well . Mm . And uh the corporate identity should be clear in the design of the remote control . And we have to decide on the functions , and on the , let's see what was it , uh the target group . We have to make be clear what that is . {gap} group of users , or {disfmarker} Yeah users . because it says below forty I mean . {vocalsound} Yeah so I think it's easy but {disfmarker} I guess that's that's the tar yeah uh or male and female {disfmarker} But uh it's it's also for children or just uh {disfmarker} Yeah it's below forty so we can decide where to {disfmarker} Uh six {disfmarker} the marketing research started on s on the age of sixteen . Okay . Okay . Sixteen to twenty five , twenty five to thirty five , thirty five to forty five , something like that . Okay . So below forty is okay . So um {disfmarker} But we need an {disfmarker} lower level which to s uh focus . How do you mean ? So is it from sixteen to forty ? Is it from twenty to forty ? Is it from thirty ? Uh sixteen to forty . Yeah ? 'Kay . Yeah . We we have to {disfmarker} Well I I guess people of sixteen are are quite used to technology . Yeah . So they they adapt to it pretty soon I guess . And if we have a larger public we have uh yeah more options to to uh sell our product . Yeah . Yeah so what we might wanna do is uh yeah cust I have customised the screen functions , if you know what I mean . Mm-hmm . The uh younger users are more acquainted with these kind of machines so they can use more advanced functions . But maybe elderly people don't understand it so well , so they need a simpler remote . Design . Mm . And yeah that you can choose what the design displays , or wha whatever . Yeah that's that's why uh I wanted to to make yeah two uh different uh yeah groups of functions . The the simple functions for for the the whole public , and the the advanced options for the younger people yeah who are more yeah experienced with uh {disfmarker} Yeah . Mm-hmm . {vocalsound} And maybe y Experienced yeah . But uh all incorporated in the screen or or just on the remote itself ? Na I w I should uh put uh the the yeah the extra advanced options on the onto the onscreen display . Yeah Yeah . like like you have a visual of the of the brightness with with a kind of sliding bar and a bus and and stuff like that for sound and and vis and and visuals ? Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . So is {disfmarker} you should have a menu for all the the functions you don't use regular and which are {disfmarker} Uh you can make a {disfmarker} if you make a drawing . Yeah . Yeah . Aye yeah . Uh {disfmarker} Uh {gap} . Shall I uh {disfmarker} Uh black's okay . {vocalsound} And draw it very big . Yeah . It's okay . Oh . {vocalsound} Yeah . {gap} no , it doesn't have line control , so {disfmarker} Yeah . {vocalsound} Yeah we get the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah well , this is basically uh it's {disfmarker} The remote ? The remote , yeah ? alright the remote ? Um well usually the power button is on top I guess . Basic . Is on top . Which should be easy , easily reached with the thumb . Yeah so it should fit right in into your hand . Yeah . L left top or right uh top ? T I s should said right . Right . Right . Yeah , right . Right top . I most people are right-handed so {vocalsound} Okay . Yeah definitely . maybe left-handed special addition , but okay . {vocalsound} If you put it like like here . Or something . I dunno . Um then you could put a screen , like on a mobile phone , also on top I guess . Mm-hmm . Yeah but if you are using the the normal functions , the the basic functions , you normally press them on the u yeah . Do the also with the thumb . So it should be a little bit longer so that you can put your uh thumb , also reach the middle . Or you should screen at the bottom and then you can see it very clearly . Okay so y yeah you have you have it in your hand , and the screen is below , and the buttons are in the middle . You you need to be able to hold it so {disfmarker} Yeah . Yeah . Okay for example {vocalsound} if you put the screen here , it's more about the functions now than the than the layout . Yeah okay that's true . Layout . That's for the {disfmarker} Doesn't work too well . It's uh it's bent . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} I can't help it . {vocalsound} {gap} . You broke it . {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} Yeah . {gap} . Man . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Right . Yeah okay . {vocalsound} Okay you get it . Uh for example if y if you put all the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Right . {vocalsound} You want the normal piece of paper ? And you have a pen ? Yeah . And might be easier huh ? Maybe this . {gap} kind of works . Yeah ? Like if you have like uh ten buttons for for all the for all the channels , Mm-hmm . Uh . um and here one for for And the for flipping up and down . Yeah yeah . And volume control . Yeah that that usually uh {disfmarker} like here , here , here , here . Yeah I {disfmarker} Yeah . Yeah . So you have up and down for the for the channels , and left and right for the volume uh {disfmarker} And left to right . And those can also be used for the menu . Yeah exactly . I thought {disfmarker} but this is really your department , that we need just the functional display and four cursors . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah okay but this is function so if you can use them for multiple things {disfmarker} And you you have {vocalsound} And {disfmarker} most of the time you have one button in the middle . It says menu , Yeah okay . For the menu . Yeah . and then if you press it you {disfmarker} the screen gets activated and then you can use these buttons to scroll up and down and left and right to go into functon Mm-hmm . Yeah . and then just {disfmarker} Yeah . mo most of the time this menu button is also like okay , to to confirm a a kind of action . Yeah . So you scroll into it , okay . You select a function like v like uh bass . You just adjust it with these two buttons . Yeah . Then okay to confirm , and then uh on on each on each screen there's there should be an option to go back to a to a upper level . Mm-hmm . And then finally say okay , exit . Or or one button to exit it . Yeah . Uh in one time I dunno , that's not really my department . {vocalsound} And do we need a a logo on our uh remote control , or {disfmarker} {vocalsound} That's more your uh your department to to uh to {disfmarker} Yeah . Yeah . But it should be {disfmarker} if the screen is here then the logo should be like on on top , On the left uh top yeah . yeah . I mean it's uh {disfmarker} Yeah but that depends on where you put the screen . Okay . But it's essential that there is a screen . Yeah . Yeah I mean the position of the screen is also more essential than {disfmarker} I mean we we look where we have space left and then put the logo over there . Yeah . And for the speech uh recognition part , if we want to incorporate that , we need a microphone . But um {disfmarker} Yeah so it should be {disfmarker} I mean if you have it in your hand here , should be on top somewhere , maybe . Yeah . This would be uh {disfmarker} Why did we wanna put the display in the bottom ? I mean i No that's not s sure so {disfmarker} Okay . That's not sure uh we need a display . but it's {disfmarker} Yeah may maybe because you're {disfmarker} Because yeah if you use the functions your hand will block the display . Yeah okay but {gap} only for the basic functi if you're going to use the advanced option , you're going to press the the menu button and then {disfmarker} yeah . Yeah I mean a screen on top looks more lo logical to me . Normal for logical t Yeah . Yeah . Also because people use m mobile phones and they also have the screen on top . Yeah they're used to it . Okay the {disfmarker} yeah . That's possible . So you you just have to reach a little bit for the power button . Yeah . I mean if you grab it . On once it's on it's on . You don't need the power button . But most most of the times if a if if a T_V_'s on standby people just press a channel to put it on . Yeah , okay . Okay we put it on top . So we put this on top , and then make the corporate logo Yeah . like over here . R_R_ . And j and the microphone , I mean it can be very small . If you look at your mobile phones {gap} are some stripes , {vocalsound} little little holes . Yeah . Mm-hmm . Maybe on the top or even on the side . {vocalsound} Yeah maybe on the side . I mean if the if the microphone is good . Yeah but then it's possible that you cover it with your hand so {disfmarker} Yeah . True . Yeah okay . So on the on the top is better . I think that top is the best option . {vocalsound} But if you uh if you hold the ma the remote like this , if you put it on the top on the side {disfmarker} Yeah okay . I dunno . Should be able to work . Yeah . {gap} . Depends on the sensitivity of the microphone , but I think that's okay . Never mind . Can we leave this up to you ? {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah it doesn't matter that much . So {disfmarker} but um the screen is on top ? Which functions did we have left ? I mean this is basically numbers , volume , uh channel up and down . Volume . Up . Channel up and down , and the control of the advanced options . Screen is over there . So maybe it , we should decide what advanced options we want to put in the L_C_D_ screen . Yeah . If we {disfmarker} Yeah . Yeah . That's uh that's a good one . Yeah so we we needed to integrate the sound and uh and image options right ? Yeah so sounds ? {vocalsound} Like uh bass uh {disfmarker} Yeah . Sound ? so we need kind of an equaliser . If you {disfmarker} Yeah . Equaliser . So if you have sound {disfmarker} But not too advanced . I mean most T_V_s use only treble and bass . Yeah Yeah it it's just a remote control so {disfmarker} and they're {disfmarker} Yeah treble , middl middle , bass or something . They're not used often so {disfmarker} Yeah . Yeah . It's uh pretty hard to write . {vocalsound} Ah as {disfmarker} Yeah just {disfmarker} {gap} . {vocalsound} Mm . Okay but you have sound ? Yeah sounds . Yeah just {disfmarker} Yeah . oh y you have digital uh {disfmarker} {gap} . better write it down over there yeah . Of course . I'm just a {vocalsound} secretary . So you have sound . {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} Coffee ? {vocalsound} Uh yeah sound and then within sound I guess treble and bass ? Yes please . Treble bass . {gap} the mono stereo option ? Yeah . Also . Uh {disfmarker} And there there was something else also . Pitch I believe , yeah . And then pitch . Pitch . Yeah . But pitch , isn't that {disfmarker} yeah that's the the height of the tone . Yeah . The fr yeah the frequency of the tones , yeah . Yeah okay , Yeah and mono stereo . wh why would you use that ? Yeah isn't that that depends on the on the signal of the of what program you're watching . If people like talk like uh {disfmarker} Mm . Yeah . And also the tuning part ? Programming part . Yeah programming . So channel programming ? Uh so we have sound , yeah ? Channel programming . And yeah in the functionality of the Television uh itself uh {disfmarker} no no of the remote uh do do we want uh the buttons to make sound when you press them ? As a confirmation or whatever you know ? Mm . Mm . Mm . I dunno . I think it g it gets annoying . Yeah . I mean most mobile phones used that in the beginning but {disfmarker} We we could make an option for it , but uh you can disable s Under the a yeah advanced option menu you can put those things . Yeah . But uh the the television itself has also the the options {gap} brightness and uh screen colour etcetera . So {disfmarker} Yeah . Contrast yeah . yeah . Yeah but people don't want to sit on their knees on their knees in front of their television with {gap} only three buttons then it's very hard to Mm . No . Uh , so contrast , y yeah contrast and brightness ? Yeah . bright , Yeah those are the most used I guess . If you look at your monitor . uh {disfmarker} And the others were in your presentation right ? So I can just copy those ? Well {vocalsound} yeah well I guess that these were the only ones , I guess . Okay . {vocalsound} It's easy . {vocalsound} But so we have we have T_V_ options , which is all this . Yeah . I will look it up . Yeah the button options and the L_C_D_ options . The sound , sound and image . And you have in that uh the indeed the remote control options . Indeed . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah . So we need two menus kind of thing . Yeah you have basically a button menu , which you can use directly , uh according to the old principle . Uh-huh . And the L_C_D_ options are activated by some some software options , thats communicates with the infrared uh decoder yeah . Yeah with the chip and then {gap} I mean {disfmarker} {vocalsound} So you {disfmarker} You have an additional processor and and software part . Uh {disfmarker} yeah . Well {disfmarker} yeah we have power button , whether that's present . Compared to o Alright . Mm-hmm . Channel volume selection present . Uh numbers present . Yeah a audio settings , mono , stereo , pitch , bass , treble . Screen settings , brightness and colour . L_ s Yeah . Colour . Yeah I I call it contrast . Yeah con contrast is {disfmarker} Yeah I make it c colour . Yeah okay , colour and brightness . Yeah . Um and what you say , channel settings or channel programming ? So you you have an option to to start scanning all the frequencies , and when it encounters one , well it shows on your T_V_ . And then you can um {disfmarker} Yeah and automatically um {disfmarker} Mm-hmm . {vocalsound} Uh and then you can select uh a number in your remote on which you want to save it . Yeah so I've g channel program is autoseek ? Yeah , autoseek . {vocalsound} Uh name a channel , or {disfmarker} Well most T_V_s automatically display the name , which they get through the cable . Oh they get automatic names , okay . Yeah . So you only have to choose the position on your {gap} . It only has to match the the channel frequency on your T_V_ , with with the with the position on your T_V_ and and so your remote . Yeah . Yeah but can you also say I want f uh Veronica on the channel number uh five or {disfmarker} Help . If you already programmed it . Yeah . If you want to move it . Yeah that should be possible too . Yeah . How do you call that ? {vocalsound} Yeah how do you call that ? Mm ? Wait you you should be able to to browse through a list or something , which w displays all the all the values , all the channels which are possible . Channels ? Yeah . I mean like one to f thirty of or ninety or whatever . Ninety nine or something . Yeah . Just browse through it and then um in some kind of way see if it if it if it is programmed . S swap channels ? Can I call it that ? Yeah . Swap channels . Swap's good option . Okay . Uh other functions ? So you {disfmarker} most of the time if you if you swap it {disfmarker} S uh let's say for example you have uh R_T_L_ five on on channel five . And Veronica on channel eight and you want to move Veronica to channel five , most of the times you override the previous uh the previous one . Mm-hmm . {vocalsound} Okay . Well that's 's up to uh Mister User Interface Designer . {vocalsound} Yeah . It's it's pretty uh {disfmarker} Okay . yeah I mean you have to look on on the menu {gap} working design . Doch . {vocalsound} Also . on the T_V_ . That's {disfmarker} you're {disfmarker} {vocalsound} He only has to figure out how it has to look . {vocalsound} Yeah but also , which buttons you have to press to get a certain result ? And how Yeah . to use {disfmarker} And the working design was to specify how ph the physical interation between the components was , as I believe . Yeah okay . But {disfmarker} You did your homework . But um {disfmarker} yeah . Okay . Yeah . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Or or is it too hard to to ju to just do it all on your remote ? To programme the channels ? No I don't think so . No no . It should be able to do any remote . No that's {disfmarker} Uh . But I think the communication with the television is difficult . But that's not our part . Yeah . We don't have to design a protocol so {disfmarker} No . No . {vocalsound} That's true . That's true . Thank god . Okay {disfmarker} Yeah . So we have a figure a figure out a way to to do that easily . I mean th the autoseek is is not a problem . No that's the {disfmarker} I mean you uh you uh current channel and then then it just says , uh on which number do you want to save this , and you just press a number on your remote , and then say confirm , okay , and then it's it's saved . It's easier , {gap} it's it's it's harder to , if you have already programmed it , to to swap . Yeah . So but {disfmarker} So we have to think of something for that . Um {disfmarker} The User Interface Designer can design a menu for all these function I put them on the {vocalsound} {disfmarker} Yeah k kind of structure into layers . On the uh yeah can you i make a a map with with all the {disfmarker} yeah 'cause it's now {disfmarker} there are lots and lots of documents {gap} . Yeah . Yeah I can . and {disfmarker} I'll just try to reorganise uh things . Um {disfmarker} So {disfmarker} So you design the basic function menu for the L_C_D_ screen ? Uh um {disfmarker} I think {vocalsound} And and the layout of of the thing itself . th I think the yeah the layout of the screen The the layout of the remote control ? and I think you can concentrate more on the button placement and the placement of the uh screen itself on the {disfmarker} {gap} . Isn't that more the the u uh the user interface part ? {gap} . No I d I think that's more in {disfmarker} {gap} . Uh all the functional uh aspects of the remote I think are in my department . Maybe more on {disfmarker} Yeah . Yeah . I have to know what it has to do , so if you wanna you know the changing the channels kind of s thing is , I have to integrate that in the design . Okay . So he's layout and you're function . Yeah . Form function okay . {vocalsound} I think that's a that's a good separation . Okay . But do I have to to uh to yeah to make the the menu layout also ? Or {disfmarker} Yeah . Are you going to do that ? Mm . Yeah . Yeah I guess so . Yeah ? I I'm going to make {disfmarker} I think i that's your department yes , yeah o okay . because w he already knows what {disfmarker} Yeah we have to kind of work together . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . If if I make the the the yeah the menu like , I have to state which function has to be in the menu , But we're not allowed . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} and then you have to decide , it's , in a in a way that b is user-friendly . Yeah . Okay . Y you you are going to make a list of what functions are uh are going to to be on the the screen , the menu screen . Yeah . Yeah . And I'm going to make a a nice menu uh with with {gap} pages and yeah . Yeah . Yeah . I think {disfmarker} yeah . With with some l with some layers in it . Yeah and also make clear which buttons to press to get certain result , So some menus . because that's always the difficulty . Yeah . Every device has its own {disfmarker} Yeah . Yeah . Well I guess this this button , the the the okay , Menu okay . menu okay . Or you can incorporate two uh difference uh different buttons . Uh like uh for your mobile phone . Um so this is only for to get in the menu , or to exit it . Mm . And then one to confirm , and one to go one step back . Back . Yeah . So it's like the the save button on your your mobile phone , if you have a Nokia or like that . Or the or the no button . Mm-hmm . To go one step back you {gap} it's only two extra buttons , Yeah . W we {disfmarker} but if it if it's very clear that they are for the screen {disfmarker} Uh I think we have to to group , to make two groups . Um the {disfmarker} one group for the for the display , and one group for the basic functions , and {disfmarker} Yeah . Yeah but they're incorporated {gap} ? Up and down is {disfmarker} Yeah okay but we we have a m Yeah because this this is used for both . yeah but maybe that's that's not uh {disfmarker} Smart ? yeah if you're if you're z zapping uh with your uh yeah remote control , you can press the the menu button , and then you are suddenly into the the yeah the display . Into your screen . Okay . So you You wanna separate uh {vocalsound} l should leave the menu button out of here . Yeah . And {gap} and just put it under the screen , the screen {disfmarker} Put it on top . Yeah j just just group group the {disfmarker} yeah we make these the advanced functions and these the basic functions . Mm-hmm . So we make a yeah a line between them . Yeah . But we should place the screen on top , right ? Well {disfmarker} F oh yeah . Okay yeah we swap uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Okay . But that's uh J Jurgen's department . Yeah . Yeah . So we make it a {disfmarker} Yeah . You just you just find out and {gap} . You just make the layout . You {disfmarker} Okay . do we do the extra two buttons or not ? Uh {disfmarker} I think you should . Yeah . It's easier . If you put too many functions in one button it gets confusing . Yeah okay . That's true . Yeah . Yeah . So we have a a menu button and a s And to , okay and back , also . Okay . Okay and back button . Yeah . Yeah , or confirm and back . Whatever . And of course the four arrows . Yeah . No . But those are still y doubly used . Both the L_C_D_ {disfmarker} Should we save this picture , or or you know what it looks like ? Yeah I'm I'm not s clear about uh the the extra two buttons . We have a menu button and {disfmarker} Yeah . Yeah . That that just to to activate the screen . So {disfmarker} That's the the one with the {disfmarker} yeah okay . Menu button access the menu in the L_C_D_ screen . And then with these buttons , woa , y you navigate . You can navigate . Okay . But you can also navigate the channels . And the volume . Okay so that that's not uh {disfmarker} Yeah that {disfmarker} Those are Those are both both {disfmarker} multifunctional . yeah . Hey is it interesting for users if we put LED lights under the buttons ? So that if you uh press on the menu function that only the buttons that are used for the menu are ligh li light up . Yeah . L l litten up yeah . Yeah . Oh five minutes . That's very good idea . N Alright . Light uh {disfmarker} Yeah that's a good idea because then it becomes clear which buttons are active now , which you can use . Yeah and then it's also easier to integrate several functions in one button . Yeah sure . Yeah . Okay . Yeah . Um {disfmarker} So {disfmarker} Anything else ? Those buttons are are lit up . I think not . But just one thing . Should we use those two ? Them ? Or only this to to scroll ? I've {disfmarker} And then use the two functional buttons to confirm , to go into something ? Oh no we have to use this to adjust some some bars ? Volume . Yeah . {vocalsound} Yeah keep it optional 'cause maybe you can you know go left to right and up and down in a in one menu . Yeah . And maybe we should use this also as an okay button , still . And then just only a back button . Well we have those buttons . We use all four . No {disfmarker} The pr the problem with the okay button in the middle is , sorry Yeah okay go ahead . Yeah ? sorry , uh is uh if you're pressing up and down , you can easily press the okay once you , when you're not already at your choice . Yeah . So maybe make one uh one okay button and and one navigation button . Yeah . Yeah that was already decided . And one back . Yeah the with with the the channel and the volume uh {disfmarker} yeah m a multifunctional navigation button . Okay that's what we decided earlier on . Yeah okay . Yeah . Right okay . So {disfmarker} Yeah . You wanna close down huh ? {vocalsound} yeah I wanna close down . {vocalsound} I have to , sorry . Yeah . it's not because I don't like you but {disfmarker} Yeah . That's okay . yh we have lunch break , Already . and then we can work for thirty minutes , and I have to write very fast to make the minich min minutes . And then uh we'll see {disfmarker} Yeah . Alright . How m how long is the lunchbreak ? I don't know . Nobody told me . {vocalsound} We have to ask . {vocalsound} But do we have to write uh to write down uh the our stuff now ? Or first lunchbreak ? Okay . No I th believe there's first lunch break . Because I {disfmarker} I've everything in my head now {vocalsound} so {disfmarker} Yeah . Or you can just {disfmarker} Mm . Okay . Yeah ? Yeah . 'Kay . Yes . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} I think you can put uh the laptop back in the room and {disfmarker} 'Kay . This is {disfmarker} Yeah . Yeah . Yes sir . {vocalsound} Time pressure . {vocalsound} 'Kay . Yeah it's a lot of pressure . {vocalsound} Yeah . Sorry for my uh not finished presentation uh . That's okay . Oh yeah . {vocalsound} Oh no no . {vocalsound} Yeah we'll kick your ass later . No . {vocalsound} Uh . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Bring it on . I don't know if it works but it should be saved . Aye {disfmarker} Y you saved it ? Does it save automatically in the project folder ? Or {disfmarker} Yeah . It's uh {disfmarker} Okay . We'll see . Should be here . Smart board . Just put back my laptop . Don't know if you can use it but {disfmarker} Alright . Okay . Yeah you can open it with the picture preview or stuff like that . And uh we have to make uh some maps with uh with the all the the data we uh gathered . Yeah . I try to organise it by these three . {vocalsound} {gap} . It's it's just my own map so I put everything into the {disfmarker} Yeah {gap} yeah yeah . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} I don't really mind . I just put the minutes here and we'll see . But you got some extra information uh {disfmarker} Yeah that's in the functional design uh folder . Okay . {vocalsound} Yeah . Yeah that's just basically what I just showed . But where do you did you get the newsflash ? Yeah . Yeah I got it by {disfmarker} You're the only one uh {disfmarker} okay . yeah . I'm gonna get kicked if I don't do it so {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {gap} internet . Okay . Alright . Alright . Yeah . {vocalsound} Make me proud . {vocalsound} I'll try to . {vocalsound} So first we have a lunchbreak now ? {vocalsound} Yeah . Alright . I believe so . {gap} just ask . {vocalsound} Mm-hmm . I dunno where she {gap} .",
        "summarize": "The whole meeting was about what the group should do for the remote control, from a good-looking appearance to a joyful user experience. At the beginning, the group had individual presentations about their previous research findings. Through those presentations, all of the four got a general idea about the target market, the functions and the layout. They talked about the functions carefully as well as the interface design of the remote control later on. Finally, under the leadership of the Project Manager, all the members got some assignments for their next detailed design."

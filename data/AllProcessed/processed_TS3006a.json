        "transcript": "{vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Mm uh . {vocalsound} {gap} We're the first . Mm . We're the first ones . {vocalsound} Marketing Expert , yes . Mm . {vocalsound} So you found your spots . Yes . {vocalsound} Move to the meeting room . {vocalsound} Bling bling . {vocalsound} Yeah . Okay . Right . {vocalsound} Okay . Uh {vocalsound} where has my screen gone ? Hi . Hello , good day . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Oh yeah , we have to talk in English , Hmm . huh . Yep . Yeah . My screen is gone . It's called black . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Oh . Kick-off meeting , wow . It's uh looks uh nice . I'm afraid I'm a bit slow for this stuff uh . {vocalsound} Okay . Hmm ? {vocalsound} I'm afraid I'm a bit too slow . {vocalsound} I don't know how much preparation you guys did , Yeah . but not a lot . Yeah . No , it's {disfmarker} it was uh not enough . You see this beautiful presentation . Yeah . Very nice . Okay let's get started . Yeah . Uh I sort of prepared this . {vocalsound} Uh opening acquaintance , tool training , uh how to use the things here . Uh project plan discussion , and yeah then the rest of the meeting . Mm . Mm-hmm . Um we're supposed to develop a new remote control , that's both original , trendy and user-friendly . So , {vocalsound} {vocalsound} hope you have good ideas . I don't . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} I did my best . Um we're work we're working uh from top to bottom . Uh functional design , Not yet . then we do some in individual work , then we have a meeting to discuss the results , etcetera etcetera . And at the end of the day we should have a prototype drawn up . Uh we have available the smart board and the whiteboard . Um uh we should take some practice . I have some instructions now to do that . Yeah . Uh well you know how to {disfmarker} the documents work . So {disfmarker} Uh this for toolbar . You see it next . Um we have a pen . And we can use this pen to perform . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yes . Operations . So {disfmarker} {vocalsound} It doesn't always work . Yes . Yeah . Okay so you can draw . Draw . Alright . Okay and in the format menu you can select colour and line width , etcetera etcetera . Okay ? 'Kay . Uh {disfmarker} Okay . Each of you can uh take some practice and you should draw an animal . Uh you should explain {disfmarker} Uh with different colours and with different pen widths . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} And you should explain why you draw that particular animal . {vocalsound} Okay . {vocalsound} Don't take up too much space . {vocalsound} So , Julian . Um yeah . Different pen widths , how do you do that ? {vocalsound} Uh with the format menu . Oh okay . And use different colours etcetera . {vocalsound} It's a giraffe . Yeah . And {vocalsound} what's that supposed to be ? {vocalsound} Are you serious ? {vocalsound} Should it be one {disfmarker} Oh yeah . {vocalsound} Oh yeah {vocalsound} Okay . four legs . Uh-huh . {vocalsound} Giraffe's yellow . {vocalsound} Uh it needs some uh some yellow uh {disfmarker} Oh format . Can you use one blank sheet per drawing ? Or Yeah . so y you must save it at the end Yeah and then {disfmarker} you can press the next button , which is uh {disfmarker} yeah . I'll show you . That's some spots . I in the file option menu . Yeah . In file menu . Okay , No . then m make a new one . {vocalsound} How much time do we have to draw anyway ? {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} 'Cause I can take forever on this . {gap} Okay . Do I have to explain uh why I chose this uh this animal ? Yeah . {vocalsound} I think it's a it's a great animal . What is it ? {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} It's a it's a giraffe . A giraffe okay . Yeah I see a long neck Yeah , that's a {disfmarker} but {disfmarker} {vocalsound} It's more like a dinosaur . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Um {disfmarker} Okay I'll will give it an uh an eye . Okay . That's nice of you . {vocalsound} Uh . Hey . Come on . Some leaf to eat . {vocalsound} {gap} {vocalsound} Okay . Yeah pretty good . Uh could you press the next uh {disfmarker} The next ? Yes . Okay . Then uh {disfmarker} {gap} . Here you go . {vocalsound} Yeah . Thanks . Hmm . Yeah . {vocalsound} Is this part of our a acquai or introduction to each other ? Yeah sorry , introduction and get acquainted {vocalsound} Uh {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} Alright . That's the idea , so {disfmarker} Uh . Your line broke . {vocalsound} Yeah . Alright . {vocalsound} Yeah it's a bit slow , It's not that fast . so {disfmarker} Yeah . Yeah . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} I see . It misses the spot . {gap} pressure . I'm guessing a turtle . No . {vocalsound} I'm kidding . {vocalsound} I say good guess . Uh {disfmarker} Why a turtle ? Because of its shell . Because it's slow . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} It's slow . 'Cause it's so You were slow too 'cause it's green . {vocalsound} so {disfmarker} Yeah I was a bit slow too . Dude you're a good drawer . So {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Uh some other line uh width uh {disfmarker} Do you have a turtle pet ? {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} No . {vocalsound} Uh okay . I dunno . {vocalsound} Does it have legs ? {vocalsound} Yeah yeah yeah . Yeah sure . Yeah ? Yeah not exactly legs but {disfmarker} More like fins {vocalsound} Stumpy stuff . or {disfmarker} It's more like a tank . Yeah that's fins They kind of l look like mole legs . With sharp nails on . but I don't know where . {vocalsound} Yeah . Some spots . Ah some eye . {vocalsound} Yeah {vocalsound} it's l looks very friendly . {vocalsound} Yeah that's a fr {vocalsound} friendly turtle I guess . {vocalsound} Yeah well I think it's uh fair enough . Yeah okay . A little tail maybe . {vocalsound} {gap} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Right . {vocalsound} I don't know what the position is . {vocalsound} Does it have ears ? Uh no . No . No . No . Oh okay . The little holes maybe . Can you erase ears Yeah yeah yeah . {vocalsound} or {disfmarker} There's a a gum , Yeah ? Alright . gum to {gap} . Eraser . And why did you choose this animal ? So {disfmarker} He said it was slow . I dunno . I it just came into my mind . So there's no particular reason Alright . I {gap} pen . {vocalsound} I like it . {vocalsound} Yeah . Well I'm {disfmarker} guess I'm done . Okay . {gap} That's my turtle . Your turn Niels . Alright . How to select the next or {disfmarker} The next here . yeah . {gap} Colours were under format {vocalsound} Yeah . Makes new paper . Here you go . Yeah . right ? Let's see . Orange . How am I gonna do this ? Um {disfmarker} Mm uh . A rabbit I think . Kangaroo . Kangaroo . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Not quite actually . Fox . A fox yeah . Dog . Firefox . {vocalsound} No . Cat . Aye . {vocalsound} It's a cat . It's a cat . Mm . Not quite yet through . A cat who had an accident or {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Why a cat ? Uh yeah I dunno . They're my favourite pets . You have some uh ? Uh I have colour already . Yeah I'm not so good at drawing with this kind of {vocalsound} The pen , st Oh shit . Um {disfmarker} yeah . Excuse my language . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Sure . {vocalsound} I don't know how to draw its face . But you get the idea . Yeah . {vocalsound} Alright . It's a cat . It's my favourite uh pet animal , 'cause they're cute , they're independent and cuddly , I dunno . {vocalsound} Okay . That's it . Yeah . Or do I need to use more colours and {disfmarker} {gap} I think it's okay . You get idea Alright . right ? Yeah . Okay um {vocalsound} we have a financial aspect to this project . {vocalsound} Um we can sell them at twenty five Euros . Uh the aim is to reach {disfmarker} uh uh to sell as much as fifty million Euros . Uh that's quite a big amount of money . And the production cost should be the half of the selling price . Okay So we have to s now it's time for some discussion . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {gap} Okay . Uh {disfmarker} What uh what uh do you want to discuss ? {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah . Yeah . {vocalsound} We should get started . Yep . Yeah . Uh I'm taking notes . Um Okay . Great . we each have a specific task , as I saw in my mail . I didn't know if you received the same mail . Mm-hmm . Yeah . Yeah ? I guess so . Yeah . Yeah . Okay so the um {vocalsound} uh {gap} this industrati Industrial Designer should produce a working design . Am I correct ? True . Okay . Uh the User Interface Designer should specify the technical functions . Right ? Yeah ? Yep . {vocalsound} And the Marketing uh Expert should come up with user requirements . Yeah . Uh did any of you already do some work on this part or {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Well I started making an overview for myself , um what I had to do , 'cause we have three design steps and in every step I have a s specific task to perform or whatever . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . So I had to uh , {vocalsound} I dunno , make an overview for myself about what I have to do , Mm-hmm . and kind of let it work in to get ideas about well how I have to fill it . Mm-hmm . And do you have any ideas about the product uh so far ? Well I started I started with the first phase , I think was the functional . Mm-hmm . And uh let's see I had to focus on the working design , which you said . Mm-hmm . How does the apparatus work ? And well I basically had two points . Uh {vocalsound} according to the coffee uh machine example , I have batteries to supply energy , {vocalsound} Yeah . Yeah . and we ye use button presses to activate or deactivate certain functions on the T_V_ . Mm-hmm . {vocalsound} Okay . And that's basically all I have so far . Yeah I got another point . It uses infrared light to communicate the signal to the T_V_ apparatus or stereo . Yeah . Wireless uh {disfmarker} huh . Yeah . Alright . Yeah . Yeah . So that's very common . Uh it's uh some buttons for for the on off function . You d you already told that . And for the changing up to the {disfmarker} to all the channels and changing the volume . That are the the basic options for a remote control . Yeah . Yeah I kept it global 'cause {vocalsound} {disfmarker} that it activates or deactivates specific functions , Okay , yeah . 'cause I wasn't thinking yet about that . I mean , you wanna ch ch flip the channel Yeah . but you might wanna use teletext also . Yep . Yeah . I dunno what the word is in English . Uh {gap} {disfmarker} Same I believe {gap} . Yeah . {vocalsound} Uh and what did the Marketing Expert do ? Uh well from a marketing uh {vocalsound} perspective , um well the function des design phase uh consists out of the user requirements . Mm-hmm . Um what needs and desires are to be fulfilled ? So there are a few means to reach that um by by doing research {vocalsound} uh to see what existing products are there out in the market . Mm-hmm . I mean , what functions do they have . Mm . Um especially what are their shortcomings ? Are there any new functions uh which can be added to our product ? Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Um therefore we have to to do some internet search . For example for um well what kind of applications do current remote controls support , and what are f featur features of uh current and future televisions ? Yep . Yes . So we can see uh what needs to be supported . Um {vocalsound} and we can interview current users and future users . What w what would they like to see uh on a new remote control ? Um especially for future users , Okay . Okay . uh I'm thinking of early adopters , because they they use new technology first , Mm-hmm . and they play with a lot of tools and stuff so maybe they have some good ideas to uh to add . Okay . And you can get that information ? I think I can get that information , yeah . Okay . That would be very handy . So {disfmarker} yeah . Um but have you any idea so far as what uh the user requirements are ? No n not specifically . No ? More to how to get them No okay . {vocalsound} I got some uh requirements and {disfmarker} Yeah ? it has uh {gap} it has to be user-friendly . Yeah ? {vocalsound} Of course . Yeah . Obviously . Yeah . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Uh really easy to use buttons , not not uh very small buttons , but not the the also the big big buttons , but just normal buttons . It has to be a small unit . It has to be uh {disfmarker} yeah , you can take it with you uh everywhere in in your house . So it has n has not to be l yeah , gigantic uh machine . Big , mm-hmm . Yeah . Uh and a and a good uh zapping range . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Uh what do you mean by that ? Uh the distance uh from your television to your uh remote control has to be , uh yeah um yeah , quite a big distance . Yeah . It has to be capable for zapping uh {disfmarker} Yeah . From the other end of the room or something ? Yeah . Yeah . Okay um {disfmarker} Well I don't think I have anything more to add at the moment . Um I think the best is to go to work . Whoa . Is that you Yeah . or {disfmarker} alright . Okay . Any more points to discuss ? Yeah . I think we can go ahead with what we have . I will summarise the things we discussed and put it in the project folder . Uh the use of the Industrial Designer can work on the working design , etcetera etcetera . And it seems you get more information by email . So {vocalsound} Alright . Alright . that was it for me . Okay . 'Kay . Thanks . Uh {disfmarker} Are you going to put the the notes on the {disfmarker} Yeah , in the project folder . Yeah . Yeah . The pro okay . Okay . {vocalsound} I'm writing very fast . {vocalsound} Alright . Yeah . {vocalsound} Yeah . Okay . Hope it's readable . Yep . Uh . Okay {vocalsound} um anything more you want to add to the discussion ? I guess so . Well no I'm just a bit wondering what we're gonna do the next uh session ? Yeah . Do we only have to to do uh phase one , the functional design uh ? Yeah . Because then we have a {disfmarker} After that we are going to the conceptual uh {disfmarker} Yeah . {vocalsound} Yeah . Y you do some individual work , We're just working the three phases . we have meeting , individual work , meeting . And at the end of the day we have a final meeting . And then I have to prepare {disfmarker} uh I have to defend our design , {vocalsound} so make it good . {vocalsound} Yeah okay . We'll do our best . Okay . I depend on you . Okay . {vocalsound} Better make it {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I am gonna work on the conceptual design already 'cause yeah it's fairly important to know what kind of components we want to put in . Yeah ? If you can mix it it's okay . Mm-hmm . Yeah . Do we {disfmarker} I mean , is it gonna be a multimedia control centre ? Do we want to be able to use the video recorder with it ? {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} That is my question also Yeah . because like new new functions {disfmarker} Well I think that is the user requirements part . Requirements . Yeah . As to what they want . Uh do they want all those functions on that small {disfmarker} Yeah . True . Yeah . But but we need good communication about this stuff , Unit . Yeah . 'cause I have to f put the components into the design . Yeah . Mm-hmm . I would first m So if I don't know what components to put in , it's kind of hard . Yeah well Yeah I understand . I I was {disfmarker} Yeah . I I think we have first to start with the basic functions and we can uh expand them . Yeah You can always add a few {disfmarker} well like l li like some like some some remotes who are out there , which I know , there's one button which is very easy to switch between devices . Yeah . So you can switch to your video Hmm , and then the same buttons control your video . the C_D_ player . Yeah . Yeah . And another function I'll think of switch to your media centre , because that's getting very popular . Yeah so {disfmarker} And then use your Windows media centre {vocalsound} under your T_V_ with the same remote control . So with the switch , one single switch {gap} Yeah . Okay . Okay . Yeah I I know what you mean , but you'll ne need several other buttons for a video player . S Mm-hmm . You need a play and a forw fast forward and a stop function . Yeah Okay . And you you don't need that for a T_V_ . records and stuff like that . And and for a t uh teletext you need additional buttons as well , No . You need additional {disfmarker} yeah . Yeah . Yeah . so I kind of need to know what we uh need . Yeah . Uh {disfmarker} Yeah . Whatever , I'll just put my ideas in uh in here Yeah . and then we can discuss it with the next uh meeting . In the project uh {disfmarker} Yeah . Yeah . We could just start with the assumption that's only for T_V_ and video . And um reserve the possibility to add other features . Okay . So we have a basic starting point Okay . and you can always extend that so make sure it's extendible . Yeah . Yeah it it has yeah it has to be user-friendly . Alright . Yeah . So it's hasn't {gap} {disfmarker} it's {disfmarker} yeah . {vocalsound} Th the least amount of functions possible Yeah . so it's easier to get to know how it works etcetera . Okay . Yeah . Yeah . I understand . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah ? Okay and uh I'll see you again uh when the computer tells us to . Alright . Yes . Yeah . {vocalsound} Yeah , you're di dismissed . Can we leave now Half an hour . or {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Thanks . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} You're fired . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Not yet . No . Mm . Alright . {vocalsound} Okay . Alright let's move on . Let's see what we got to do . Yeah . {vocalsound} See you later . Yeah . Okay . Yeah see you later . Good luck . {vocalsound} Yeah . Thank you . Well good luck . {vocalsound} What the {disfmarker}",
        "summarize": "In their first meeting, the team members got familiar with each other through some icebreaker games. Project Manager started to introduce the new remote control project with the team's financial goal. The unit price was determined to be 25 Euros. The production of each remote control would cost 12.5 Euros. The team would have to make sales amounting to 50 million Euros. Project Manager continued to assign individual tasks to the team members. Industrial Designer had worked out a rough plan for the first phase and would produce a working design. User Interface was supposed to specify the technical functions. Marketing would be responsible for market research. Users mainly expect the remote control to be user-friendly and handy. The team decided to focus on the basic functions at the first stage but make sure the extendibility of the functions as well."

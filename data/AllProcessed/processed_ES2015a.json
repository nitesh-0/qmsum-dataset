        "transcript": "Alright , that did nothing . Okay . Welcome to the meeting everyone . Just gonna attempt to make this into a slide show . Sorry guys . You may have to do the function F_ eight thing . I did . Twice . Oh , okay . {vocalsound} This'll just take a moment . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Okay okay {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Or it won't . {vocalsound} Okay we'll have to deal with it like this then . Okay . {vocalsound} Alright . Um . This is the first meeting uh for developing our , our new product . {gap} I'm Heather , I'm your Project Manager . Hello . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Okay . So um . So that was the opening . {vocalsound} The first thing we'll do is get acquainted with one another . If everyone could go around and explain their role and um , and their name . {vocalsound} Okay . My name's Poppy . I'm the Industrial Designer for this project . Um , I'm going to be responsible for the functional design phase . Also the conceptual design and the detailed design for the final product . Nice to meet you Poppy . Okay . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} My name's Tara and I'm the User Interface Designer . {vocalsound} I will also be responsible for the functional design phase , the conceptual design phase and the detailed design phase of the user interface design . {vocalsound} Alright . Hi , I'm Genevieve . I'm the Marketing Expert . I'm an expert at marketing . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Um , I'll be telling you guys about the user requirement specifications for our new product . Um , I'll be doing some trend-watching in the conceptual design , and product evaluation for the design phase . Alright I'm Heather and I've I said I'm your Project Manager , um Well you can pretty much read what it is that I'm doing . But um um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah . And uh tool training is one thing that we're going to be doing today , um um as well as planning the project , how we're going to , uh , create this product , and , um , discuss , um , our aims and objects of this , Which brings us to our next subject , {vocalsound} is , um , um , {vocalsound} as a team we're going to be designing and creating a new kind of remote control . Um , we want this to be a marketable product that can be trendy , um , a completely new style , so that , um , can really appeal to a , to a generation that doesn't want a simple plain kind of , uh , channel-changer . And , um , it needs to be user-friendly for , um , maybe , for an example , for people that , um , can't see the numbers as well , or , um , perhaps an ergonomic design . Okay . So this is a television remote control ? Yes , it's a television remote control . Yeah . Right . I believe I should be taking minutes on this right now . So , alright . Okay . Um , yeah . Um , the way that we're going to go about this is , um , we'll have a time where we can , um come up with new ideas alone , and , and work on the project and then , um , after we've brainstormed and , and thought about , we can come together in a meeting and , and discuss what , what um , what kind of functional design we want to use . Same with conceptual design and detailed design . So , um , making sure that it , it's usable , that as a , um {disfmarker} and that it's , it's feasible to create , and uh , to come up with a concept of it want , what we want it to look like . Um , tool training . Is , is everyone , um {disfmarker} {gap} Okay . Yeah . Got those notes . Yeah . Great . Great . Thank you . Um One thing that , uh , we're going to do is become more acquainted with the , the tools that we have access to for our project . Um , one of them is our whiteboard . And , um , as a sort of team-building moment , um , I , I'd like us to , um , try out the whiteboard by expressing our favourite animal and the charac characteristics of that animal . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Um , why that , why that should be your favourite animal . So , um , I , I'm assuming that we should do that now . Okay . {vocalsound} 'Kay . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} With our microphones still attached to our bodies . Okay . {vocalsound} Okay . Gosh . {vocalsound} 'Kay , what's my favourite animal ? {vocalsound} Do come up . {vocalsound} Oh , {vocalsound} {gap} to go first . {vocalsound} Oh , This is a team-building time are we all doing it individually ? {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} where , um , {vocalsound} , Okay , let's stand up and support you {vocalsound} okay cool , um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} My favourite animal , which changes all the time , okay , {vocalsound} {vocalsound} right now it is an elk . {vocalsound} Okay . An elk ? {vocalsound} alright , so {disfmarker} {vocalsound} A vicious {disfmarker} {vocalsound} And it goes like {disfmarker} Yeah it's got like big antlers , {vocalsound} yeah . Looks kinda like , like it has holly growing out of its head . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Do you have elk where you come from ? Yes . You do . Yeah We have moose too . {vocalsound} we have moose and we have deer . Okay . {vocalsound} Do you have {disfmarker} We have sheep . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {gap} 'Kay , um . {vocalsound} Sheep . Yeah , {vocalsound} cows . {vocalsound} That's a great elk . Uh-oh , we have a good artist . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} That is really good . {vocalsound} Thanks . {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} I'm quite {disfmarker} {vocalsound} This is my {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Oh , very shapely . Okay . Brilliant . That's a sketching of my my elk , and it , it is my favourite animal right now , 'cause it is a large beautiful majestic creature , {vocalsound} that um , that um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} In a way it looks kind of awkward , because it's on spindly legs and it uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} But it can really overcome harsh terrain , and although it's gorgeous it's also very dangerous , because it has um strong antlers , and uh it can really combat its enemies , even like it it's a it's an herbivore but , uh , it can really defend itself . Mm . Yeah . Very nice . Okay . Right . {vocalsound} Right , I'm gonna take minutes while , um , you guys express your favourite animals . {vocalsound} Okay , I'll go next . I am a big animal lover . like all sorts of animals , but for the moment I'm gonna draw a cat , in memory of my poor cat that died recently . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Oh . Oh . It's gonna be a bit of a strange drawing , but never mind . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Not as artistic as Heather's drawing . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Bit more cartoon style . {vocalsound} But I like cats because they're so independent , and they always seem to be doing what they want to be doing . Um , but that doesn't mean they're completely not sociable , 'cause they enjoy interacting with humans as well , and they seem to enjoy the good things like sunshine and , um , running around outside as well as being inside , and enjoying their food , and generally just , they just seemed so cool and {vocalsound} they just know what they're doing . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Uh I reckon they're sort of , they got it sorted . They know what they want . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Basically , that's why I like cats . {vocalsound} Very good . {vocalsound} Great . {gap} I'll rub that out . There you go . {vocalsound} Okay . I think my favourite animal would be a dog , but I'm not really sure {vocalsound} how to draw one . Ooh . I , I've never drawn a dog , I don't think . I'm tempted to draw a snail 'cause I draw them sometimes {vocalsound} and they're really easy to draw . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Um , I forget her name . right it's gonna be a really funny dog , 'cause I'm not sure how to draw a dog . Tara {vocalsound} or Tara . Well there are loads of different types of dogs , so I'm sure it'll represent one kind of dog . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} It's a cartoon dog I think . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} A s I don't ev Oh , oh well . {vocalsound} It's a scary cartoon dog . That {disfmarker} This , {vocalsound} that does not look like a dog . {vocalsound} It looks kinda like a person . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} We can pretend . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} I'm sorry . {vocalsound} That's Pinocchio . {vocalsound} {gap} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} How do you draw a dog ? I suppose it has a lon Oh my god . Right . Yous know what it's supposed to be . {vocalsound} Okay . {vocalsound} It's a dog . {vocalsound} . Um , I like dogs because , um , they're so good to humans , like they can be trained to be police dogs and seeing-eye dogs , and they're just such friendly animals . And , like they're more of a companion than cats . Yeah , that's true . {vocalsound} I've nothing against cats . Cats don't really like me , so I can't like them . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} But they're just so friendly and warm and nice animals , {vocalsound} {vocalsound} that don't look like that . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Alrighty . I feel like a robot . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Okay . Um , well I guess I had the most time to think about it . I'm going to draw a butterfly , because I saw a butterfly yesterday , that seemed to be like the symbol of Spring arriving . And it was actually the prettiest butterfly I've ever seen out in the wild , and I though that was pretty cool in Scotland . It was like , well it was a little pointier than that . At first I thought it was a dead leaf . {vocalsound} And then it landed on the wall next to me . But this part was all brown and then it has these big blue dots like this . And then it kinda {disfmarker} there was a green , I think it was a green ring , and there was like red going out like this . It's kinda like a peacock . {vocalsound} Yeah , it kinda was actually , 'cause it was {disfmarker} This part of the body was really dull , and then it was the most colourful exotic butterfly ever , and I'm like , wow this is the middle of Scotland in like March . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} So I thought that was pretty cool . And it landed by a wall and let me look at it for about two minutes . I wish I'd had my camera . So that's gonna be my favourite animal because after all the snow it seemed to say that like Spring is finally here . Yeah . Very nice . {vocalsound} There you go . Great . {vocalsound} Uh , what do we {disfmarker} Oh . Do you hear the eraser buzzing while you do that ? Yes I do . {vocalsound} {gap} Yea {vocalsound} Right . {vocalsound} So , now that we know how to use the whiteboard , Okay . um , the next , um , thing we need to address is our financial department , to meet our our budget , um {disfmarker} or not meet our budget but more , um , like what kind of , uh , selling range we'll be looking at , um , wanna make this um {gap} selling price of twenty five Euros . And so we have to , um , come up with a way to , to create a , a uh remote control , where um we can {disfmarker} like the price to create it will be significantly less . Um , we'd like to , um to , uh , make fifty million Euro . I'm assuming that's what the M_ means . Um , and make it for an international market . Um , one thing we'd have to think about internationally is in the design of , um , like different kinds of , uh , V_C_R_s . Things like that , depending on which country you are . Another thing for the design team to think about . Um , we want it to cost , uh , absolute maximum of twelve Euro and fifty cents . Okay , so we'll have a hundred percent profit then ? Twelve fifty . I'm bad at math . Okay . 'Kay . {vocalsound} Um , {vocalsound} so now that , um , that is underway , um {vocalsound} it is discussion time . So this is time for us to bring our initial ideas , any um suggestions that you may have so far , a um your personal experiences with remote controls , and um , um , areas you see that , uh , could be improved in your experience with them . Does anyone have any initial thoughts ? I find that in the dark it's often hard to know what button you're pushing . Mm-hmm . So what's something we could , uh , do to remedy that ? {vocalsound} {gap} Okay . Um {disfmarker} I always find that in our house the remote control always goes missing . {vocalsound} It's always , where is the remote control ? {vocalsound} Yeah . So maybe if you could have some kind of tracking {vocalsound} device for the remote control or some signal that you could find out where it was . {vocalsound} I dunno , some kind of alarm . You can press a button on your wall , {gap} signal , Yeah . It's a great idea . It's a great idea . {vocalsound} 'cause it always gets lost . Do yous not find that , um , {vocalsound} like , there's a lot of , um , buttons on your remote control , and you don't know what half of them do . Yeah . Mm-hmm . Yeah , that you don't use half of them . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah , I don't know what they do . {vocalsound} Mm-hmm . There's some remote controls where there's kind of a hidden panel , so all those buttons that you don't really use unless you're programming or something . Yeah . Yeah , that's , that's {disfmarker} That's useful . Yeah , it is . Yeah . So you just have like the number buttons , power button , T_V_ video button . Yeah . Yeah . Alright . Anything about , um , the look of the , uh , remote control that you might have ideas about . Maybe it could be , instead of like a standard rectangular shape , it could be , um , something more interesting like {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Any ideas will do that you have at this point . Mm . Could be shaped like a conch , {vocalsound} Can hold it . {vocalsound} A novelty . {vocalsound} you know . Be like a shell-shaped remote . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah . Are we going into kind of novelty factors here . Like , I've seen phones like a {disfmarker} Well if it's a trendy original , um , aspect we're going for . Okay . I mean , you're the designers , you c , you can um decide what kind of , um , direction you wanna go in , Yeah . Mm-hmm . Yeah . but at this point in the , in the first meeting it can be any ideas that we just throw out there . Yeah . I suppose , if we're he heading to have it , like make a huge profit out of this , it needs to be quite a universally accepted thing . Like , a novelty thing might only sell a few things rather than , like , a general kind of more acceptable {disfmarker} Yeah . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} . Mm-hmm . But we don't wanna go towards boring , 'cause that wouldn't sell either . Yeah . So , hmm . And the key issue here is , is being trendy and original . Um , that does not necessarily mean it needs to be outrageous . Yeah . Yeah . Right . Okay we have five minutes left . So , just to cover {disfmarker} We have one more thing . Um , like you can go over your ideas , of course , in your own personal times . Um , our next meeting will be in half an hour . Yeah . So you have half an hour to , uh , think about what you want to present . Or not present but bring to the meeting . Um , I_D_ , whatever that stands for . Industrial Designer . Interface ? Industrial Designer . That's me . {vocalsound} Oh , industrial . I have to remember these things . Um . You'll be beginning your , your working design . Mm-hmm . Um , U_I_D_ the technical functions design will , will be worked on the next thirty minutes . Um , {vocalsound} maybe how this can be achieved , and , um , we need the user requirements from the manag Marketing Expert . Marketing Expert . {vocalsound} Um , you will get specific instructions , um , of what to do in the next half an hour . And I'll see you in half an hour , okay ? Okay . 'Kay . Thank you . {gap}",
        "summarize": "This was the first meeting on the team's project. It started with every member introducing themselves, getting to know each other's names as well as their individual roles in the project. Project Manager then revealed the overall plan for their project, announcing that they were going to design a new television remote that would be both trendy and user-friendly. After that, each person drew their favourite animals on the whiteboard and shared their reasons for the choice, with Project Manager choosing an elk, Industrial Designer a cat, User Interface a dog, and Marketing a butterfly. Project Manager then added some financial details to their plan, setting their selling price and cost. In the following brainstorming time, they raised ideas on night-time operation, a tracking device, and the design for buttons and shape. Finally, Project Manager arranged tasks for each team member to take on until their next meeting."

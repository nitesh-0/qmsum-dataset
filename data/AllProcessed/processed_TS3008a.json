        "transcript": "{vocalsound} Hello . {vocalsound} {gap} {vocalsound} Dang it . {vocalsound} And then you have to place your laptop exactly on the marked spot . Alright . {gap} It's important to place your laptop exactly on the marked spot over here . Okay . No , that's okay . Joost , your mouse . What ? No mouse needed ? I've got a touch-pad . Mm . Do you know how how I can wake it up ? A touch-pad ? No , my laptop . Slap it . {vocalsound} You with your brilliant ideas . I don't know if I can touch the power button . Do you know how how I can wake it up ? Is {disfmarker} No . Yeah . Try the power button . Oh . {vocalsound} Come on , move it . Um {disfmarker} Now , wake up , bitch . Huh . F_ five . F_ five {gap} . I've lost my screen . Uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Yeah , so did I . I don't . I closed it . That wasn that wasn't very smart , I guess . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Come on . Get back to me . Yes . Yes . {vocalsound} I closed the {disfmarker} I closed it . You've got your name . {vocalsound} Yeah , my name is name . No , I didn't restart it , I just closed it . Yes . Hope it working . Alright . No . Never close your laptop . Yeah ? Everybody's ready ? Yeah . Great . Thanks . Great . Well , welcome to the kick-off meeting . I uh forgot to put my name over here , it's uh {vocalsound} it's Martin . Uh , so you all know . {vocalsound} Well , this is the agenda for today . Well , the opening is what I'm doing right now . {vocalsound} Uh , we gonna do some acquaintance acquaintance things . Uh give some um examples of the tool training , project plan discussion and the closing . We have twenty five minutes . Okay , the project aim is to design a new remote control . Mm-hmm . Uh , some of the {vocalsound} oje objectives are that is has to be original , trendy , and user-friendly . So now we all know what our Okay . goal is . Um , I {disfmarker} oh forget {disfmarker} I forget the whole acquaintance part , but we we all know each other . We all know each other's names . Joost , Guido , Antek . What is your name ? Yes . Yes . Antek . Antek Ahmet . And Joost . {gap} Okay . I think we uh al already uh been through that part . Okay . Yeah . Okay , it consists of uh three levels of design . Uh we begin with the functional design , then we go to the conceptual design and the detailed design . Every uh level of design consists of some individual work , and we uh close it with a meeting . You all received an email with a example of our explanation of what uh the particular level of design uh means to the different uh functions , and uh you p you probably read that already , so I don't have to tell you about that . Yes . Yes . Okay , first we're gonna um uh gonna try some different things with the tools we have over here , so you get acquainted with these uh um uh meeting tools . We have the smart-boards , uh the thes those two boards . This is the presentation boards , wh which one I'm using right now . You can uh um {disfmarker} there's a document folder called um the sh {vocalsound} shared document folder . You can upload your uh documents to that folder and then you can open them over here , so you can do your PowerPoint presentations on this screen . We also have the white-board . Uh , we're gonna skip through th Can we see the white-board on our laptops ? No , no . Just on the on the screen over there . No , I saw I saw the file , the smart-board that X_B_K_ but {disfmarker} Oh , no . Probably is , but I don't know if the software is on the laptop {gap} . Is is {disfmarker} if it's mainly a thing for in the meeting , so I don't think it's {disfmarker} I don't know if it's important . Okay . This an explanation of the smart-boards . There is a tool-bar over here . It's quite simple . You have the the pen function , eraser function . It's like a very simple uh paint application . Uh , we {disfmarker} well , we use the same file during uh the whole day , and uh you can make new sheets by uh by pu puttin pressing on the blank button . It works like this . Oh . {vocalsound} If pen is selected , yes . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Oh , no no . With that pen ? It's not {disfmarker} But it is pen . It's not working like a pen yet . Mm . Huh . Huh . Mm . It's doing some stuff now . So you can use a pen . Little bit slower . You can use an eraser . And you can make new uh fi uh new blanks , and you can change uh the line width and the colour of the pen by pressing on forward , which y you have to select pen format . And then select current colour or line width . So , it's quite easy . Uh well , now you're all uh acquainted with the different tools . Right , we're gonna try out the electronic white-boards . Uh , every participant should draw his favourite animal and some of its favourite characteristics , {vocalsound} {vocalsound} on blank sheets with different colours , with different pen widths . Uh , I'll start off then . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} I'll use this uh same sheet . Alright . Oh , let me think . Different colours . Oh . {vocalsound} Well , I'm gonna draw um a p piranha . Uh , a fish . {vocalsound} piranha . Okay . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Uh . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Mm-hmm . I'm gonna use some different colour {gap} now . Oh . {vocalsound} Some {disfmarker} a little white . Looks like a fish . Think it is . Oh . {vocalsound} Oh . {vocalsound} Uh , colour . This is black ? I think so . Yellow {gap} {disfmarker} Oh . Oh , this is just uh {vocalsound} useless uh drawings but {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Oh teeth . I need teeth . {vocalsound} Well , they're not supposed to be green , or whatever colour this is . {vocalsound} Hmm . Okay . What was uh {disfmarker} I have su to sum up its favourite characteris Different . Well , I like its uh sharp {disfmarker} razor sharp teeth . {vocalsound} Plus , uh the the big uh forehead and uh a small uh , well a small actual face . And I like its overall uh aggressive look and {disfmarker} Well , that's what I like about uh piranha . I think that's kind of what uh the intention should be . Okay . Well , who wants to be next ? Nobody , I guess . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} I will try . Yeah . I will try . Uh {disfmarker} You go , Guido ? Okay . Uh , make a new sheet . Uh , it's by pressing on blank . Blank ? Yep . Okay . Then pen again ? {vocalsound} Yep . Okay . And uh {disfmarker} so in the format menu you can choose the different uh colours and uh pen widths . Okay , um {disfmarker} Format . {gap} control . Uh {disfmarker} Ah , purple . Um , I don't know what my uh favourite uh animal is , {vocalsound} but the easiest animal I can think is is a bird . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Uh I will {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} You know , I thought of that actually . That's my bird . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah ? Yeah . Isn't it quite {disfmarker} it's a little bit light . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Uh , another colour maybe . A red one . {vocalsound} A small one . Uh , line width . Two ? Three . Oh that's okay . That's another one . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Well , tell us something about uh your favourite characteristics of these uh particular birds . {vocalsound} Ano {vocalsound} Uh {vocalsound} uh {vocalsound} it's a {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Its simplicity . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah , it's uh the most simple uh animal I know , I think . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Um , I don't know . Maybe because uh there's there's some s uh free uh maybe in the sky or something like that . Oh , okay . Okay . Maybe a little bit . Yeah . I don't know . Okay . No , uh it's clear . So {gap} more uh birds ? N no {vocalsound} no . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} We get your point . Okay . Who wants to be next ? {vocalsound} {gap} Okay , {vocalsound} okay , {vocalsound} okay . {vocalsound} Yeah , whatever . I'll go next . {vocalsound} Thanks . M I haven't got a favourite animal too , so {disfmarker} Pictionary . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Oh . {vocalsound} What should I draw ? {vocalsound} Oh . A cow . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Okay . Thank you , {vocalsound} I'll draw a penguin . {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} I'll draw a penguin . Whatever . I can't draw , so you can start to laugh already . {vocalsound} I'll do so . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Whatever . Something like that . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Come on . Yeah , it's little bit hard . Mm hmm hmm , orange . Orange , of course . Whatever . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Oh , {vocalsound} it's better than your bird . {gap} Uh yeah . {vocalsound} Everything's better than your bird . {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} True . Whatever . {vocalsound} Hey , it's blue . No . Whatever . Um , I like its ugliness {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} and uh {disfmarker} Yeah , whatever . The way it walks or whatever . Okay . Your turn . {vocalsound} 'Kay . {vocalsound} Drawing . {vocalsound} I'm going to draw a cat . I don't know why , but a cat is a very uh smart animal . {vocalsound} And you can have them at home . {gap} Which is not as the case with uh with bingwings and {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Well , you can have a piranha at home . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Ye yes , {vocalsound} yeah . {vocalsound} Huh . Or a line . {vocalsound} A little bit . {vocalsound} I mean a bird . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} Don't mess with my birds , yeah . It's not very uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} very good drawn , but you can see a cat from it . {vocalsound} Hmm . It's a handicapped cat . {vocalsound} {gap} cat . I don't think uh I don't think uh Darwin would agree with that . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} It's {gap} {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Ah , it's not scared . He's crying but {disfmarker} {gap} . Okay . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} He's crying because it's ugl because of his ugliness . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} What do you like about it then ? {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Uh it's i most cats are small . Oh , okay . You can handle them . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Okay . Okay . Okay , {vocalsound} {vocalsound} and then we are uh through the tool training , I guess . Okay . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} I wouldn't call it training , but {disfmarker} Okay , this is uh something about the project finance . The selling price of our remote control is gonna be twenty five Euros . And our profit aim is fifteen million Euros . We're very ambitious on this one . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} The market range is international , so it's gonna be sold world-wide , and the production cost should be a maximum of twelve Euro fifty per remote control . So that's clear . {gap} {disfmarker} Yeah ? Okay . {vocalsound} Alright . Okay , we're now gonna discuss some stuff when {disfmarker} well , we're gonna brainstorm about uh what kind of kemoro romo remote control it's gonna be . Uh , well tell me about your experiences with the remote controls . Do you have uh {disfmarker} know what good experiences with remote controls ? Or do they annoy you sometimes ? Yes . Are they difficult to understand , or maybe they don't interact with different kind of uh equipment very well ? Hmm . I don't th I don't think the four of us got problems with remote controls , Yeah , okay . but if you see elderly people , all these buttons , and then they buy new T_V_ because their previous one was stolen or whatever . Different . Okay . And then a totally different remote control with with different functions on different places , and half of the functions a are removed , or whatever . Uh , so I think what we need is is a clear uh remote control with uh grouped buttons , you know . All th all the buttons which apply to the text functions in in one uh {disfmarker} Different functions of of uh {disfmarker} Well , one area or whatever , not like the button to enter text on top of the remote control and the button to um , yeah , to minimise it to this this {vocalsound} {disfmarker} or whatever o o other functions {vocalsound} totally somewhere else . Okay . Yeah . I think we should group them . Okay . And same for the for the volume buttons and the the t And uh , is it gonna be a remote control that's um {disfmarker} what it can be used for different kind of equipment , like your T_V_ and your home stereo ? Well I was I was thinking uh since a T_V_ is uh mostly used together with a V_C_R_ or D_V_D_ player or recorder , and not with a stereo , I think it should be good to include functions for V_C_R_s and D_V_D_ players , recorders . Uh {disfmarker} Yeah . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . But uh , the D_V_D_ players and home cinema sets often double as stereo hi-fi sets probably . Yeah . It's what , from my experience . But isn't it {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I don't know . Hi-fi set is uh not often used uh as I know of in combination with television . Okay . But we gonna {disfmarker} It's only for television , I thought . Not {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Yes . Oh , it is only for televis {gap} I thought it was only for television . So so we probably don't have to have to uh have the functions for D_V_D_ player or V_C_R_ . Yes , it is only for television , but uh {disfmarker} So wha what {disfmarker} What wha {vocalsound} what uh what document {disfmarker} Well {disfmarker} well we we're gonna brainstorm about that . If we think it's useful , we do it . But , where where did it uh {disfmarker} Where did you find that ? Uh , in the email . Oh , okay . I thought it said uh {disfmarker} That's right . It's a television remote control . Yeah , television remote control . Yes , {gap} {disfmarker} But I was thinking since it is useful with D_V_D_ {disfmarker} Yeah , but most television remote controls support other functions as well . So we can {disfmarker} Yes , that's uh something extras . No , we have to think about that . True . Yeah . Okay , uh but uh we've gonna put some a uh is is it so user-friendliness , is a is a pri priority in this case , or {disfmarker} True . Yep . Yeah , yeah . Yeah . Yeah , also no one's gonna buy it . Okay . Yeah . True . Only the experts . {vocalsound} I guess . Well , this the maybe is uh some aspect of the {disfmarker} uh , or or some point at at which we can excel by making it very useful . {gap} Yeah . That w Well , then you're you're the usability uh man , so this uh gonna be a very important task for you then . {vocalsound} Oh my God . Okay . {vocalsound} Yeah . Okay . Well , other ideas ? How can we make it trendy or something ? Do uh by just sh shape and the look of it ? Uh , to go with to go with fashion and {disfmarker} Maybe a can opener underneath it ? {vocalsound} For the bear . Uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} I don't know . Or someth something special , like uh M_P_ three player inside of it , or uh {disfmarker} I I uh , no I think it {disfmarker} Oh , well then the production costs are gonna be too high probably . Uh , I th I think yo we have to keep it simple , to get a whole market . Yeah , way too high . Yep . Okay . Maybe with different type of fronts or uh {disfmarker} It's international , so we have to use a standard . Well , m has to be something {vocalsound} spectacular or uh one which makes it {disfmarker} Well that's an idea of course , yeah . We gonna skip back to the goals probably . Uh , Mm-hmm . original , trendly , and user-friendly {disfmarker} Well , we al also already talked about user-friendliness . Hmm . No , well something trendy and original , well that that goes hand in hand I guess . When something is original , it tends to be trendy , probably , {vocalsound} Yeah . or we should make it combination of that . 'Kay , so you {vocalsound} {disfmarker} the um technical part of the process is something you're gonna look after for , so you have to think about what kind of uh equipment you want to uh , you know , you want to manage with it . Well , and that's an important part for you then , with gogors regards to the user-friendly part of it . Use friendly . Yep . Well , and you uh should look out for what makes it trendy . {vocalsound} Well , you know , y like some special feature . Or some {disfmarker} {gap} Does it does it gets some gadgetness or something . Yeah . Yes , what the market wishes . Okay . Well , the closing . Next meeting starts in thirty minutes . Individual , I think so . The the Industrial Designer will w or the working design , of course , we will uh {disfmarker} Already s said that . The User Interface Designer {vocalsound} {disfmarker} is it a User Inter User Interface {disfmarker} Yeah . Yeah , yeah . Interface d Yeah . {vocalsound} the technical functions design . And the Management Expert of uh {disfmarker} the Marketing Expert . User requirements specifi Well , this one was already clear to us . Specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach . I don't know how much time we have left . {vocalsound} Oh , not many I guess . We started at twelve . You just got a message . Oh , and what does it said ? And it said uh five minutes , so we got four and a half . Oh , I don't {disfmarker} W Okay , well um {disfmarker} I didn't get a message . No . He's the whatever . Oh , the Project Manager . Team Leader . {vocalsound} No , we're uh ahead of schedule then . Team Leader . {vocalsound} He is the whatever . {vocalsound} Yeah , close it . I'm gonna make some minutes or take some minutes . {vocalsound} Okay . {vocalsound} Yes . And uh it's it's clear you can put the stuff in the project documents presentations . Okay . You can all {disfmarker} Or we're all uh {disfmarker} Project joc project documents is for showing uh on the white-board . Yeah . Yeah , but we're all familiar with uh uh Microsoft PowerPoint , are we ? Yeah . Yeah , okay . Yeah . Yes . I'm gonna wri uh write some stuff down Alright . and then we're ready . Okay . Or we can leave already {gap} I guess . {vocalsound} Yeah . {gap} or uh or sh or should we uh {disfmarker} or is important that we leave at exact uh {disfmarker} No . Okay . No . I don't think so . {vocalsound} I don't think {disfmarker} Oh {disfmarker} Yes ? Yes . {vocalsound} Oh . Great . We'll see each other in uh thirty minutes . {vocalsound} Yeah . Good luck . Yeah , good luck . {vocalsound} I will need it . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} I will need it . {vocalsound} {vocalsound}",
        "summarize": "This is a kick-off meeting for a new remote control project for television sets. Project Manager started it with a review of project objectives and then the team got acquainted with each other and tools. Through discussion, the team decided to design a remote control with grouped buttons, useful with DVD players and carrying some special features to be confirmed."

        "transcript": "Okay . Here we go . Alright , the agenda for thi oh . Alright . Um the agenda for this meeting {vocalsound} is um {disfmarker} we'll initially have the prototype presentation by our two designers . And then we will evaluate it , given the criteria that um that we gave gave it . And um talk about our finances , whether we were under or over our budget . I have a um a spreadsheet where we can calculate um our prices for every aspect of of what we've made , given our options . And um evaluate the product , as a group . Okay . And um {disfmarker} So first we'll have the prototype presentation . Do you need the um PowerPoint for this ? Um yeah . I just got a few slides , so show them . Alright . Thank you . Do you want to present it ? {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Um {disfmarker} Yeah , here we are . {vocalsound} This is what we came up with . It's a pretty simple design . It's um based on a mango ? Yeah . And {vocalsound} we {disfmarker} {vocalsound} On ? {vocalsound} Mango shape . {vocalsound} A mango . Okay . Yeah . And we have the company logo here and this will be the infrared here The L_E_D_ . and this'll be the power point , the on off button kind {disfmarker} Oh . Okay . yeah . I'm sorry . Oops . What was the {disfmarker} where's the L_E_D_ ? It's in the middle of one of the little R_s . Oh . Okay . And then the other one is the power . And uh we just have a simple design . We wanted it all to be So it's palm-held . accessible from your thumb Yeah . {disfmarker} yeah palm-held Yeah . and all the buttons are accessible from your thumb . Notice you have a number ten button . So you don't have to {disfmarker} Oh that was a mistake , wasn't it ? {vocalsound} Okay . {vocalsound} You just need the nought . {vocalsound} Right no , that's a zero . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Take that one off . {vocalsound} Sorry . I was in charge of the numbers . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} No problem . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Ah . And this is just if you've got like eleven or twelve or thirt the plus . So one plus one would be eleven , {vocalsound} You can go one , three or something . or {disfmarker} Oh . You press a plus button ? You press that first and then you go one three yeah . Oh okay . I've never heard of that kind before . Well we just thought , we have all the numbers here , so we wanted something representative of numbers larger than ten and {disfmarker} Yeah . Yeah because if you {disfmarker} on your average um remote , if you press one twice you just go to {disfmarker} um or uh say you wanted channel twelve , you press one , and then you go to channel one , and then two then you'd just go to channel two , instead of twelve . Yeah . Oh , there's no e Oh . So if you did like one plus two you could go to channel twelve , or two plus two is channel twenty two . So the plus and then {disfmarker} okay . yeah . I Okay . But {disfmarker} Would you have to go zero plus one if you wanted to go to channel one or two ? No no , th all {disfmarker} that's why we have all these numbers . These numbers um these numbers all work independently up to nine . {vocalsound} Yeah but I mean if you press , it'll go to that channel right away . 'Cause you gotta press the plus afterwards . Yeah . Oh no . Uh , the plus is only for if you're going past the number nine . Yeah I know , but if if I wanna go to say number like sixty five , channel sixty five , if I press the six it'll go to channel six , and then I'll press the plus , and then it'll go to six and then put the five and it'll go to sixty five ? Sixty . You p Oh . No you press the plus first . Oh . I I {disfmarker} well it doesn't {disfmarker} we haven't really s I would've thought you pressed the plus first and then the six five , {vocalsound} but she says plus {disfmarker} {vocalsound} press {disfmarker} which {disfmarker} Well I don't mind , we can further define that . what do you think is simpler ? I th Um {disfmarker} It's a {disfmarker} I wouldn't have thought it'd be a problem that it went to channel six first , in like on the way to channel sixty five . Yeah . Yeah it wouldn't be a problem . But I was just wondering But I suppose it's not as snappy . Yeah . like as long as we realise that's what it'll do . Well the there is a {disfmarker} there's a delay on remotes I think . Oops . Yeah . Where you can have it {disfmarker} Yeah . it's like a five second input time . Yeah . If you don't put it {disfmarker} So as long as you hit them dada Yeah . Yeah , Yeah . that {disfmarker} yeah . {vocalsound} it should be fine . Yeah . As long as there's not a big pause between the t hitting the two buttons . Mm-hmm . Yeah . So {disfmarker} Um {disfmarker} Was there {disfmarker} so on the top there is volume and {disfmarker} And channel , A channel . which is so you could just go like that without thinking about it , like {disfmarker} Channel up volume up . Okay cool . C_ and V_ . Just so we can flick {disfmarker} Right , where um where's the power button ? Yeah . It's in the middle of one of the little R_s . {vocalsound} It's the bigger R_ . It's the R_ . Oh okay . So it's just like {vocalsound} . Yeah , Yeah . so it's all accessible . Without m taking your hand off the remote . We deci Yeah . Yeah um we went for like a a circular design for the numbers Mm-hmm . because we thought that's kind of a more natural movement than just going like that with your thumb . Oh okay . Uh e ergonomics are all considered . Yeah . Mm-hmm . Ergonomic , definitely ergonomic . And {vocalsound} it might actually help with the repetitive stress injury as well . {vocalsound} It could cause another type of repetitive stress injury though . Okay . {vocalsound} But yeah , no I mean it's a different movement {vocalsound} so {disfmarker} yeah . Yeah . Um and the feel of it , I mean , we've made this out of Play Doh , which is representing the , you know , the rubber , and the spongy rubberness . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} The spon yeah . Yeah . {vocalsound} Um 'cause it was said before in the material specification that this {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} this anti-R_S_I_ um material is often used in stress balls so this has got a you know a bit of give to it , Yeah . and it just feels feels different . Yeah . Bit of a stress ball feel . Would you like to feel it yourselves ? Yeah . {vocalsound} Yes . I would . How it fits in the palm of your hand ? {vocalsound} My goodness . {vocalsound} Thanks . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} There you go . And you ? {vocalsound} Genevieve ? Yes Yeah . {vocalsound} . Oh it's nice . Oh I think I killed the five . {vocalsound} I did . And something hmm . {vocalsound} I killed the four . Oh god . {vocalsound} O Okay , as for the colours , we were presented with um a limited range of colours for this prototype . Of Play Doh yeah . Oh it smells good . {vocalsound} But we're thinking that , seeing as we're having it in interchangeable casing anyway , that this is not necessarily a representation of the true colours that we would necessarily use . Or the combination . Um and we're thinking to carry-on with the fruit and vegetable theme , the colour um combination just could just be named after different fruit , like banana could be black and yellow , watermelon red and green , Oh right . or vanilla might be the most popular if it just uh blends in 'Cause it'd be quite subtle and {disfmarker} more settled cream instead of the others are all a bit garish . Yeah . It looks more {disfmarker} Think like vanilla and banana would . Banana's more representative of our colour scheme , like the company {disfmarker} the yellow and black . Okay yeah . Yeah . So that {disfmarker} for corporate identity that would probably be the most strength . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} I mean watermelon , you know , m probably appealing to the {disfmarker} Kinda Christmas , you know . yeah , seasonal . Yeah , yeah , yeah . {vocalsound} Apple green , brown , more kinda trendy , you know , khaki {disfmarker} Yeah . The pomegranate's kinda girly and funky kind of , Cool . and then the vanilla's more for the more sophisticated {vocalsound} customer who just wants something that fits in with all decor . {vocalsound} Yeah . Okay . Um yeah we thought of the components it was definitely um a focus of ergonomics and just a single ha handheld device , I mean you don't need to use both hands , one hand to hold this and type in with the other , you can just use your thumb . Yeah . Um , as we said the rubber's probably used for comfort and anti-R_S_I_ and that's about it . Alright , thank you very much . {vocalsound} Good work everyone . {vocalsound} Bravo {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Alright . And so now that we've we have a prototype , uh we need to go over the finances and seeing if this prototype matches uh what our budget can handle . Mm-hmm . So , I have something I'm going to {disfmarker} Oh wait a minute . You want the {disfmarker} Do you need to do a presentation first ? {vocalsound} I don't know what order it goes in . Yeah . I'm gonna check that out for a second . I have one . Mm go {disfmarker} What time is it anyw {gap} Oh yeah sorry you're right . Evaluation criteria is next in line . Evaluation cri Okay . That's me . Yeah . Hello . Oh there we go . Okay . Come on my computer . Come on . {vocalsound} Sorry my computer's giving me technical difficulties . Just press um function eight again . Should I press it again ? Last time I did that it sh Okay . You're right . And then again I think . One more time . Oh . Still not there . Yeah . Yeah . Okay now I think for this one I could {disfmarker} Would you guys prefer use the whiteboard or mayb maybe I'll just do it on {disfmarker} right on the screen where you can see it . Um , we're gonna be doing an evaluation report together based on the protoptype that we've just seen . Um and looking looking back at my notes from our {disfmarker} both our conceptual and our functional meetings , um I made a list of what our original requirements and goals were , um , back to our kick-off meeting this morning . Um , and we'll evaluate as to whether we've s done what we set out to do . Um and we're gonna do it on a one to seven scale where one is true and seven is false . So basically the lower p the lower the points the better . {vocalsound} Okay so question number one . Does the remote {disfmarker} whoops . Sorry . Oh I'm not gonna be able {disfmarker} um , I'll do it on the whiteboard . I can't change it so I'm g I'm gonna ask you to push it down once . Okay . I'll write down our scores up on the {disfmarker} Ooh . Okay so number one . Do we have a fancy look-and-feel ? Feel I think . Mm . We've been quite successful with the rubber coating Yeah . and {disfmarker} The look is a little bit more playful . Well {disfmarker} Yeah . Yeah . Yeah I guess that depends on your definition of fancy , but it's definitely different . Oh definitely different yeah . It's not your traditional {disfmarker} yeah . I think the colour has a lot to do with it . I mean {vocalsound} th the colours we were given for making the prototype aren't the colours that I think we would've necessarily chosen . Mm-hmm . Yeah . It's not the kind of {disfmarker} ooh uh at all sleek Oh you were only given red and black ? {disfmarker} red , black and yellow , and orange . Oh okay . Yeah {vocalsound} so {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} not very sleek and we don't wanna go for black because most remote controls are black or grey . Yeah . So we want it to be stand out that way , anyway . Yeah . Okay . But if you can imagine that in like a s just a {disfmarker} maybe uh a kind of pale metallic-y finish or something {disfmarker} Yeah . A metallic-y finish we were thinking . {vocalsound} Well I know know it's for rubber . Mm-hmm . Yeah . I mean diff if you can visualise this in nice colours I think it would look quite fancy . {vocalsound} Polished . Okay {disfmarker} Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . I kinda {disfmarker} I like the potato look . It's mango . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Oh well , potato , mango , fruit and veg . {vocalsound} We we were {vocalsound} we were thinking about {disfmarker} {vocalsound} It's very different . It's what ? It's mango . {vocalsound} Oh sorry the mango the mango look . {vocalsound} Potato's fine . Potato's fine . yeah . {vocalsound} Yeah it is , fruit or vegetable depends on your mood . {vocalsound} Yeah . Totally . It's really adaptable . So I myself would say a one or a two . Yeah . I would say two . Personally . I w I'd say two I think . It's a two ? For the Okay , Fanciness . and p Yeah . fancy {disfmarker} One being true . So {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} uh two , three . {vocalsound} Two . Yeah . Okay , actu that's pro that's gonna get confusing , like that . Okay so question number two was {vocalsound} is it techn technologically innovative ? So I know we have the kinetic energy which is very innovative . Yeah . Yeah and the use of the rubber . {vocalsound} Use of the rubber , the use of the L_E_D_ . For the anti-R_S_I_ . Yeah . Yeah . The L_E_D_ use isn't particularly innovative Isn't {disfmarker} and we don't have any scroll buttons , it's all pushbuttons , Mm . there's no L_C_D_ control , so if we're thinking about the rest of the market , it's sort of probably halfway . Mm-hmm . Yeah . In some aspects it is , like we said . Yeah . I'd say maybe three . I'll go for three as well . Yeah . And I think {disfmarker} I mean it it's tough to say because we were {disfmarker} we didn't want it to be any more innovative than this , because then that would've defeated the purpose . Yeah we want it simple . Yeah . Though it was our specification . No . Wouldn't be simple , yeah . So I mean I {disfmarker} we'll put three , but I think we actually reached our goal . Yeah . Yeah . {vocalsound} We didn't want it any more than that . Okay question number three . Uh , will it be easy to use ? I think so . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah very . Yeah . I think one for that . Yeah . S Yeah Yeah . One . I think it's {disfmarker} Yeah . Yeah . you can't really get confused with that . No . Th I mean , there'll be s we have to work out the uh number {disfmarker} the plus system . The plus number thing . Yeah that's the only thing yeah . But once that's figured out , it should be fine . Yeah and perhaps the turning on but {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Number four . Is this a good-looking remote ? Mm . Remember that seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly . {vocalsound} It's definitely {disfmarker} Again I think the colour comes into this . Yeah colour will definitely be a factor . Mm-hmm {vocalsound} . I think that the logo could be smaller . Okay . And maybe not such a prominent way . Yeah . Maybe like at the bottom , kind of . But the {disfmarker} Not in {disfmarker} Remember the management said that it it had to be prominent . Oh it just had to be on there I guess . Whoops . Yeah . {vocalsound} Should just not touch it . {vocalsound} Don't worry . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} This time it's the three I killed . {vocalsound} I was just wondering if it should be like flatter . Or {disfmarker} I suppose I've got quite big hands . I like the appeal of it being like a big glob in your hand . Well {disfmarker} Yeah . {vocalsound} But you know what I've just thought of there now . What {disfmarker} where's it gonna sit in your living room ? Is it not gonna fall off the arm of the sofa ? Maybe if the bottom was just sort of flat , and then the rest is like Yeah the bottom could be like ch chopped a bit . Yeah . round . But then it wouldn't sit as comfortably in your hand {vocalsound} . Oh . That's true . It would still be comfortable I think . We c we could handle it I think . Thing is like that , it's not going anywhere particularly . {vocalsound} Yeah . Maybe , it could {disfmarker} it could be on the bottom , so you wouldn't loo like if it's flat here , so it sits up . Yeah . Like that . Oh that would be nice . {vocalsound} Ah it'd fall over all the time though . It'd be annoying . Uh yeah , it's less um , what's th ha . Yeah . I g If it's weighted maybe . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} 'Kay we're done designing . H it's got higher centre of gravity like that . {vocalsound} Details , details . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Come on . Okay . So , is this a good-looking remote ? {vocalsound} Would we wanna show it off to our friends ? {vocalsound} Three . You would though , 'cause it's bit {disfmarker} it's more interesting than other remotes . Yeah . I think , it was another colour and it was like {disfmarker} I think it'd look okay . I think maybe a two . Yeah ? I would definitely go for that rather than like your average plain old remote like that , I mean I gue yeah , it's personal taste , but {disfmarker} Yeah . Yeah . but definitely in another colour , I'm not happy with those colours . Okay , so should we say two for that ? Sure . Yeah . Yeah ? Yeah . Okay . Uh , question number five . What's um {disfmarker} will people be willing to spend twenty five Euros on this product ? Remember that eighty percent of users were willing to spend more money when a remote control looked fancy . I think we have to market it in the right way , that um {disfmarker} to say that it is simplistic . Yeah . Mm-hmm . So people don't just see it and think , uh , this is so simplistic , I don't want to spend twenty five Euros . Yeah . We have to market it . Yeah . Yeah it {disfmarker} the marketing will have a lot to do with it . And {vocalsound} the kinetic energy , shaker-style-y , whoo , And the kinetic energy part . Yeah . Yeah . {vocalsound} Durable . {vocalsound} ooh no . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Shake it and the buttons fall off . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} But you know , those'll be firmly on . {vocalsound} Don't shake {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Oh no the plus . {vocalsound} You're No , I guess , I don't know much about the remote control industry , how much your average sells for , {disfmarker} use the zero . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Make a new one . But you're our Marketing Expert . {vocalsound} but {disfmarker} I know I am , aren't I ? I think they're about ten po ten pound , aren't they ? About ten pounds . Fifteen ? But you don't have to buy batteries . So in the long term this can actually save you money . Mm , yeah , that's true . Yeah . Oh . Exactly . Exactly . So we'll market it that way too . Yeah . Good point . So yeah I think with a good marketing scheme um and the personalisation options , it'll {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Yeah . I would give it a two still though . Yeah . Yeah . Mm . Yeah . Okay number six . Can someone read it out ? {vocalsound} Does this prototype match the operating behaviour of the average user . Or {disfmarker} Mm . Yeah . Um yeah . So that was mainly that the statistics {disfmarker} Yeah . I think it does very well . Oh yeah . Because {disfmarker} we said {disfmarker} yeah , because the most accessible buttons are the volume and the and the channel-changing . The zap {disfmarker} Yeah . And it's just {disfmarker} you won't have to think about it . yeah . Mm-hmm . You don't have to look down to find them . {vocalsound} They're clearly there , easy to use . Yeah . Simple . Uh {disfmarker} Yeah I guess the {disfmarker} I think the key word there is average , 'cause there were some people that used the uh video input and sound and stuff . Yeah . But they're not you and I really . Mm . Yeah . So . Okay so one ? Yeah . Yeah . Okay . Number seven . C Heather could you push it down ? Will this remote control be easy to find when lost ? Remember that fifty percent of users lose their remote regularly . We have the alarm system . Now is there the {disfmarker} is the alarm system still {disfmarker} was it implemented ? Yeah the bu when you press the alarm system , the {vocalsound} lights {vocalsound} behind the {disfmarker} and it'll vibra {vocalsound} It {disfmarker} Yeah {vocalsound} l lights on and , or flash as well . But I mean it's not obviously obvious from the outside that that's gonna happen 'cause you can't s particularly see an alarm . It'll be again in the marketing . I thought the light from the inside was gonna light up . Yeah . The light {disfmarker} it will . Or or was it gonna make a noise ? Yeah . But when the alarm's not {disfmarker} But {disfmarker} yeah . If you {disfmarker} {vocalsound} But both {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} You press the button it makes a noise right ? {vocalsound} It turns into a duck and starts quacking . Yeah . Yeah . You could s {vocalsound} Yeah . Awesome . Awesome . Yeah . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Oh , that would be brilliant . Here I am . I'd be tempted to {disfmarker} Well the thing is , if it was {disfmarker} had an alarm system , {vocalsound} Um {disfmarker} I mean , when it when it lights up as we I mean it could light up when the alarm went . But if it was hidden underneath the cushion or something , there wouldn't be any point . Yeah . So you can't see the alarm , but it would light up . It would have to be in the market I though w it was gonna make a noise . Okay . Yeah . Alarm , Yeah but you still couldn't see it . but you can't see an alarm inside uh {disfmarker} the alarm system itself . It would just be a little speaker on the back or something . Okay . We {disfmarker} oh you're just explaining why it's not on the prototype . Yeah . Yeah . It w yeah . But yeah , it'll be there . Oh okay . So we can {disfmarker} we could say that {disfmarker} Whoo . Okay . Sorry . {vocalsound} We can give it a one , because compared to every other remote ever m ever made , this one will be easier to find . Yeah , totally . Yeah . Okay . Um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Sorry Heather . {vocalsound} No problem , mm . That wasn't very clear . Question number eight . Will it be easy to learn how to use this remote when brand new ? Remember that thirty four percent of users usually found it difficult . Totally . So it has to be {disfmarker} yeah , it's eas they'll pick it up and they'll know what to do . So the plu the plus {disfmarker} w once that's written down on the page that'll be really simple , The plus thing needs to be worked on . Yeah . Yeah won't it ? I think {disfmarker} Yeah . just because it's {disfmarker} we've decided to reduce it down to the basic buttons , I think that in itself makes it so much easier to use . Well {disfmarker} Yeah . Do {disfmarker} Does it make more sense for the middle one to be an {disfmarker} just an enter button ? So then you would have to push two buttons every time at least . Yeah , so it's just like channel six , six , enter . That kind of annoys me though , when it's zero six when you have to press {disfmarker} {gap} Mm . Yeah but you don't have to press zeros . I don't know why . {vocalsound} You could just press six enter , Oh okay . Right . And then like twelve , enter . And {disfmarker} or sixty six enter , y or one two enter . Alright , aye . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah I think that's probably more straightforward . Yeah . Good {gap} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah . Um , okay so we can {vocalsound} {disfmarker} I'd say w yeah one . we'll say yes it's uh one ? Yeah . Yeah . Okay . Ooh . Mm . Question number nine . Oh . Uh , will it minimise the effects of R_S_I_ , which was repeated strain injury ? Injury . Yeah . Um , which affected over a quarter of users . {vocalsound} Hmm . S I think so . It's like right in the {disfmarker} But if you're zapping {disfmarker} Your thumb might get a little bit uh {disfmarker} Yeah , that's what I was thinking . yeah . I don't think it will f We may have to do some more research into other strain injuries that we don't know about . Yeah , Yeah . the biology . But it is soft . Mm-hmm . It's soft , And that's kind of what the um and {disfmarker} Mm . Mm . the PowerPoint slide thing said would be good for R_S_I_ , And people could {disfmarker} Yeah . Yeah . Mm-hmm . so {disfmarker} maybe it is but {disfmarker} I don't know what other options there are . I think we're getting {disfmarker} Yeah . that's true . Could {disfmarker} I mean , you could hold it in your left hand and d use your index finger . Mm . But there's not really any other options unless it's like a keyboard . Yeah . Yeah . So , I think we did as as much as you can with a remote control . Yeah . So , one or two do you think ? I think {disfmarker} I I'd say t yeah , I think too . two . Yeah Yeah . Two okay . Okay number ten . Did we somehow incorporate the company colour and logo ? Yes we did . {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} Now is the colour gonna be there even if it's like vanilla ? {vocalsound} N We we can't really do that Is the yellow {disfmarker} because for example on the banana theme we can't have it as being yellow . {vocalsound} It won't stand out . Mm-hmm . So n it's not always gonna be the same colour . It sounds like the colour's something that we {disfmarker} Well , yeah the colours are yellow and grey . Yeah . Gray , yeah . So it could be grey on the banana one . Yeah , could be grey . Yeah . But I mean the yell yeah d yellow's ugly though , Yeah that's right , depending on the {disfmarker} we didn't even rea So I think we'll have to talk to our executive managers , and see if we can get away with just the R_R_ . Mm . Yeah . I think this is the Yeah . the factor that we've been least successful in confronting . Okay . Perhaps a metallic Mm , yeah . or or {disfmarker} like that's grey , and it wouldn't be that expensive to have a little bit of metal . No ? Yeah . That isn't rubber . And the buttons in the middle . {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} Okay So , do you think that's more of a three then ? Three , four ? Four I think . Well I don't {disfmarker} Four ? what do {disfmarker} what {disfmarker} Hum . Well we have good reasons for it , so we {disfmarker} but we can still put a a four ? Okay . Okay . Okay , and final question . {vocalsound} Um , did we stay true to our motto and put the fashion into electronics ? {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Current trends of fruits and veggies , desire for sponginess . {vocalsound} I would say so . {vocalsound} Following that briefing we did . But maybe more like two 'cause there's no like pictures of fruit , it's just sort of naming it by a fruit . Yeah . Yeah . With the with the colours . Yeah . Like um the colour scheme names and stuff . Yeah . No , uh , are the plates interchangeable ? {vocalsound} Yeah . I think I missed a few {disfmarker} Yeah . Yeah . they are ? So you can have banana and kiwi and {disfmarker} Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . {vocalsound} okay . Okay , so that's something that's kind of in the making too , like maybe it'll become more {disfmarker} That's fashionable in itself to have interchangeable plates . Mm-hmm . It is . I think w yeah , I think one . Well that was our brief and we followed the brief . The thing is , I think if somebody saw that and you said what was that inspired from , I don't know if you'd instantly say mango . Well we haven't got a big banana but {disfmarker} Oh yeah . {vocalsound} Be like {disfmarker} No . {vocalsound} No . {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} Maybe if it was scented . {vocalsound} Oh that would be class . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Oh yeah . There we go . That would be great . {vocalsound} Yeah we have money for that . Um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Alright so based on this evaluation , do we average them out sorta thing ? Um {disfmarker} Yes we do . So I {disfmarker} wh what was I gonna put for that ? Oh . A two for fashion ? I would say two . Yeah . Two . Okay . Okay , so our average there , five , six , eight , ten , eleven , twelve , thirteen , fifteen , nineteen , twenty one , divided by eleven One point nine or something ? It's {disfmarker} It's {disfmarker} is {disfmarker} Yeah . {vocalsound} I don't know these things . Um , between one and two . Between one and two . Between {disfmarker} okay . So that's pretty fantastic . Close to two . {vocalsound} Um . Yeah . Yeah , that's very good 'cause the highest we coulda got is one . Alright . I got {disfmarker} Does that seem right then ? Yeah , 'cause we've a four to bring down . Mm . Okay . Uh , aye . It seems like it should be more around two . Yeah . Yeah . Uh , should've added five . Do we have an online calculator ? I'm attempting to do that {vocalsound} right now . {vocalsound} This is {gap} . Okay . Yeah it is one point nine . Ooh . Oh wow . Well done . Yay . Go Heather Pauls . Well that's excellent . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} Alright , now with that over and done with , our next step is to see if we are under budget . And um my computer's frozen . And now it's not . Okay . So um in our shared folder , if everyone could go there right now , um I'm going to um steal a cable . Sorry . Are you gonna do that ? Okay . Um it's it's um Is that the project document ? it's an Excel file . Oh . Production costs . Yeah . Yeah . 'Kay there we go . Um , production costs . And um I have to access that as well . One moment . {vocalsound} It says it {disfmarker} 'Kay so far I've added what I think {disfmarker} or what is going on ? Great . It's blinking at me . It's locked for editing . Read only . I'm gonna open up a second one then 'cause it's locked for editing . I have the original in my um my email account . Oh is it locked 'cause I'm in it ? I dunno . I think it just means that we can't add any more to it now . Or {disfmarker} okay . Have you have you completed it ? No . No , I was hoping that you guys could . Oh right . Okay . Okay . Um , there we go . {vocalsound} Okay here we go . So we need to tally up how much our w our product will be costing . So um if you can look up at the screen , um the large screen , Yeah . oh I guess looking at your own too and telling me which one you think . Okay we're using kinetic which is quite a large expense at three Euros . Yeah . {vocalsound} Um we're using a regular chip . Oh right . Yeah . Um , it's cur it's double curved , so its curved all around . Double double-curved yeah . That's another three . We're already at five . Um , we're using plastic and rubber , Yeah . so {disfmarker} Good thing plastic is free , we're at eight . Um {disfmarker} S What about a special colour ? Yeah . Are we using that ? I guess we should do it just for one kind . So it's like special colour {disfmarker} well we'll have two colours Yeah . right ? Well one colour for the case , one colour for the buttons . Yeah . So we can {disfmarker} Mm-hmm . Yeah . Um , we have push button interface , so that's inexpensive . And um we have a special colour for the button , and we also have a special form . And a special material . And a special material . Yeah . Which puts us just barely under budget . Oof . Hurray . Congratulations guys . Yeah . Good work guys . {vocalsound} Mm . 'S good . {vocalsound} So um our operating cost is twelve twenty Euros . That's good . Awesome . And back to our PowerPoint . So we've {disfmarker} 'Kay . Yes we are . So we need to do a product evaluation , again , {vocalsound} which is probably um {disfmarker} I dunno . A different extension of a {disfmarker} Of the actual project rather than the product ? Yeah . Hmm . A project ? Is is {disfmarker} Yeah 'cause we're talking about leadership , teamwork . yeah . So wh how we actually went round uh about doing it . Yeah . Alright so um {disfmarker} Do you guys feel like there was room for creativity ? I think we were pushed . Mm-hmm . Pushed for creativity ? {vocalsound} I mean we weren't really given a lot of time , or materials , yeah , to go about our design task . The ma Or materials . {vocalsound} So I think we could've done with a bit more time . Yeah . Ye Okay . {vocalsound} So it'd be like need more time and materials . But you were allowed m creativity ? Yeah . I think so as like {disfmarker} but you were supposed to have creativ Yeah . Yeah and the conceptual and functional . Like we were very creative in in coming up with an idea I guess , but m Yeah . Yeah . Well we were just limited by resources really and like if we had decided to use the L_C_D_ screen , and like solar power backup and everything , then we wouldn't have been able to afford that . When we can down to it . Yeah . Right . Okay . So that did limit creativity . Creativity . Right {vocalsound} Just resources . Mm-hmm . Okay But yeah . The fruit and veg idea . {vocalsound} Great . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Leadership ? Is this me being like , guys do you like me ? Um . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah {vocalsound} . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Good leadership , I think we stayed on task . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah we did . We've , uh {disfmarker} seeing as we've come out with what we intended . A pro um a product within the budget . I think that's a sign of good leadership Mm-hmm . and also our personal coach helped us along the way , {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah . so you know {disfmarker} I think it's been fine . And the timing was good . We never were pushed for time , or sat around doing nothing , so {disfmarker} Yeah . Good timing . Yeah . Oop {gap} Okay . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Teamwork ? And project manager of course . I think we worked great as a team . Yeah ? Yeah . Yeah . {vocalsound} Was good teamwork . I think we are well-suited to our roles . Yeah . Yeah . {vocalsound} Alright how were our means ? Um {disfmarker} We needed more Play Doh colours . Yeah . {vocalsound} Yeah and more Play Doh , {vocalsound} 'cause that was all the red we had . Yeah . So even if we wanted to make a bigger prototype , we wouldn't have been able to . Yeah , it c it might've been bigger . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Oh really ? {vocalsound} But ever everything else was satisfactory ? Okay . Is that good {disfmarker} Yeah . Yeah . The computer programmes are good . Yeah . It could be really straightforward for the computer . The {disfmarker} I think the only thing was having to remember to you know to tick the okays Yeah . I don't think there was anything {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah . but I think I was the only one who struggled with that . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} I'm actually not sure if I've saved my presentations . {vocalsound} Yeah ? {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Mm . Uh me too . They'll probably still be there . Yeah . New ideas found . I don't really know what that means . {vocalsound} Well I think we've all learnt stuff from each other , Um {disfmarker} like the n um {disfmarker} Yeah . Through discussion . yeah . Just about each different {gap} . Got new ideas from each other . {vocalsound} I'm not sure , new ideas found . Hmm ? Yeah well I guess we really {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} we bounced off of each other , which was cool . Yeah . Yeah . Like based on marketing stuff and then you'd say something about interface and {disfmarker} Yeah . Yeah . yeah , worked well . And we were a able to modify each other's ideas Mm-hmm . Yeah . to fit in with our areas of expertise . {vocalsound} Yeah . Each other's {gap} Oh does it have smart materials by the way ? Sorry ? Does it have smart materials ? Mm . Oh yeah . {vocalsound} Oh yeah . {vocalsound} Well mm , did it come into the into {disfmarker} If if it if it {disfmarker} I dunno if we counted that in the costs . {vocalsound} If it can be afforded . {vocalsound} Okay ? Well with that achieved , our last slide is our closing slide . {vocalsound} Yes our costs are within budget . It's evaluated generally positively . Yes . Mm-hmm . Yeah . And um don't forget to complete final questionnaire and meeting summary . Mm-hmm . Then we celebrate Uh . Fantastic . Yay . {vocalsound} By watching T_V_ ? {vocalsound} in such a way that I have no idea . {vocalsound} Okay , brilliant . Alright ? Thank you very much . {vocalsound} Yeah . Okay , bye . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Mm . Conclusion ? Dadada .",
        "summarize": "Firstly, User Interface introduced the prototype of remote control based on the previous discussion of its function. The prototype was a pretty simple design in a mango shape with the company logo on it and innovative functions like the plus button. Secondly, Marketing designed an evaluation test under the guidance of both the conceptual as well as functional meetings and the team gave one to seven points to each feature of the product to see if the prototype would meet the original requirements and goals. Thirdly, the team calculated the cost of the prototype and found that the most expensive part was the use of kinetic. But the team decided to use regular chips and cheap materials, which made the budget under control. Lastly, the team gave positive feedback on the project and the process."

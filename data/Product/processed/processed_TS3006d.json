        "transcript": "Okay . Uh first of all I'll start with the costs , {gap} . because that's going to influence our design . {vocalsound} Oh no . Oh , {gap} . {vocalsound} If you {disfmarker} Don't know if you al already had a look or not ? No n I I already did it . Did you do your questionnaire already ? No . It's not much . It's just one question . Because we have a problem . Uh {disfmarker} Oh . {vocalsound} If you look closely , you can see . Yeah . It wants {disfmarker} Um I already took the liberty to make some suggestions . {gap} . {gap} . {vocalsound} At the moment we have fifteen buttons , one L_C_D_ screen , one advanced chip-on-print . We use a uh sensor , that's for the speech . Uh we use kinetic energy . And we wanted uh the buttons in a special colour . Okay . What's the first thing we should drop ? The special colour of the buttons ? No that's that's for the trendy uh feel and look . So {disfmarker} Okay . Uh {disfmarker} Yeah but everything is . Should we switch to a hand dynamo ? {vocalsound} Uh that's the still the same idea as the kinetic energy because you have to use it and do things . No . Yeah , b but {disfmarker} Yeah but young people like that . Batteries ? So just do normal battery . Batteries . I think the battery option . Just a normal battery then , yeah . Yeah . {gap} . It has to be twelve and a half . Yeah . Or not ? {vocalsound} Oh . {vocalsound} So {disfmarker} Oh my goodness . You're going to redesign something . {vocalsound} Oh no . Okay , so we're at twenty five . Uh , yeah . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Um {disfmarker} Do we keep the shape doubly curved or g do we go for single curved ? Well I guess i we'll have to go for single curve then . I mean we have to drop on everything . Mm-hmm . {vocalsound} Uh {disfmarker} But we can keep it single curved with uh top view still curved , but from the side it's it's flat , Yeah . and the screen screen is just {disfmarker} Well you just have to hold it like this then . So {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Yeah . Um {disfmarker} How about {disfmarker} Sorry . Uh another option I saw was to drop the buttons one through nine , so you can't directly access a channel , but instead use only the up and down arrows . That would skip nine buttons and four and a half Euros . That's what I was thinking . Yeah . Alright . Yeah ? A a Let's do it then . Yeah . Uh then we have left {disfmarker} But we don't have any basic options any more . {gap} we {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Uh yeah . We do . And uh 'cause then they don't have to n They don't need special colour as well . F_ eight . They don't need special colours . Fine . That's more like it . {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} You were saying something . That was exactly my point . Like let's drop all the buttons , and just make one Yeah . {disfmarker} I mean we're gonna use the L_C_D_ screen anyway . So we'll just have to use it for everything . Mm-hmm . Yeah . And then you can make an overview of channels in the screen , and select a channel , click {disfmarker} Yeah , some more menu options . Yeah . Okay so maybe we can drop few more buttons . {vocalsound} But um {disfmarker} Now let's look . Yeah we c could {disfmarker} We only need the the the the the menu arrow arrow button uh thing . Everything you can do with with the menu . So {disfmarker} With the display . {vocalsound} Mm-hmm . Yeah we need one integrated button for everything then . Yeah . The joystick . {vocalsound} Uh {disfmarker} Yeah . Kind of . I was {disfmarker} Because {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Yeah , scroll-wheel , push-button uh {disfmarker} Yeah . If you if you go to {disfmarker} Integrated scroll-wheel push-button , yeah . If you go to our uh view , like you {disfmarker} if you are in the sound system there , uh and you wanna adjust the treble for instance , Yeah . Yeah . this is just uh an example , Mm-hmm . y y you wanna see a bar on which you can adjust it from zero to ten for example . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . But you want a sound preview of how it's gonna sound , Yeah . right ? So you wanna click on it , activate it , whe and when you move it , hear the difference of the treble coming out or going into the sound . Yeah . So you'll you'll need a a kind of a joystick uh button . Yeah or or the integrated scroll-wheel push-button . Yeah . So that's kind of on your mouse and then you can click it , adjust it , click again and then you're out of it . Exactly . But you still {disfmarker} But you then still need to have {disfmarker} Well you can use the scroll-wheel as well for um maybe for the channels . But you still um {disfmarker} Yeah it's r Yeah . You still have to have some some button in the menu to go back . So you do one inte You can do one integrated scroll-wheel push-button . Yeah . And then just drop all the other buttons . Uh yeah . Well not all . But but th the cost of one integrated button is far more than a few extra push-buttons . Not s not sound I guess . {vocalsound} No . Yeah . It's uh {disfmarker} One integrated button is five times the cost of a normal button . {vocalsound} Yeah . Mm . So {disfmarker} So we have to to make it s uh more uh {disfmarker} It has to be {disfmarker} You could also drop j three more of these , without losing much functionality . You just drop the Okay and the Back . Yeah . Wh wh what what what is the what is the uh sample sensor sample speaker ? Oh , that's for the speech . Speech recognition . Yeah . Could drop the speech recognition . {vocalsound} Right . S s Drop speech recognition ? {vocalsound} No but {disfmarker} Yeah that's possible . {vocalsound} We we d Yeah it's it's expensive , but uh we never considered the possibilities of uh speech recognition . 'Cause it can take the function of a lot of uh uh buttons . Buttons . Buttons . That's not very easy to use . Yeah . I No , it can be disturbed by by noise and No . {vocalsound} Yeah but lets just say that the speech recognition works . stuff like that . Let let let me see what's more what's more popular . I guess the the screen was more popular than um than the speech recognition . Yeah . I have to look on that . Let me see . {vocalsound} Uh well no I was wrong . {vocalsound} There are more people who like speech recognition than an L_C_D_ screen . Yep . Okay . Because if you d lose the L_C_D_ screen , we {vocalsound} need a lot of {disfmarker} But if it {disfmarker} {vocalsound} But it it {disfmarker} it's a it's a both a hypers We lose our whole concept . Yeah . Uh so {disfmarker} No we just {disfmarker} We need a lot of extra buttons . No , but {disfmarker} We keep the L_C_D_ . Well we Yeah we keep the screen . I mean it's it's about the same . Eight one to ninety one percent , uh sixty six to seventy six . Okay We uh we we haven't really integrated this {disfmarker} the speech into the system , so we drop the speech . so we can might as well s drop that . {gap} And drop it yeah ? Yeah . Yeah . Let's drop the speech . Okay . S Fo Four less Euros . So we still have three and a half Euro to lose . {vocalsound} Sixteen Euros . {vocalsound} We need to lose some buttons . But y y Yeah if you lose the the Back , the Okay button {disfmarker} Uh v let's say we only have the four arrows , and the Menu button . Yeah . Yeah . Then you're {disfmarker} And then and then use um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Oh and the power button we have also . The the {disfmarker} Okay . And the menu button does also does the okay function then . Yeah . And then when you in the menu {disfmarker} So that's one Euro . S so so you activate the menu . If we do uh two integrated scroll-wheel push-buttons , we can drop all the the push-buttons . {vocalsound} Yeah . Yeah ? And {gap} {disfmarker} With with one uh integrated button we can uh do the whole menu thing . With the other , we can do the the channel , the volume , et cetera . Yeah yeah . {vocalsound} Yeah . {gap} . That would save zero point two Euros compared to {disfmarker} No . No it's three Euros . No ? Um {disfmarker} Yeah . To This together is more expensive than {disfmarker} Oof , it's almost the same as t keeping this . No it's it's n Yeah . Yeah yeah yeah . {vocalsound} And we can drop these two . Well okay . It's the {disfmarker} For example if you have f f four buttons , {vocalsound} channel up and down , uh volume left right {disfmarker} Volume . Okay , I've {disfmarker} I think we have to keep that . And the power button . And then {disfmarker} and the power button . So that's five . That's the basic . That's basic . That that's what you need anyway . And then for the menu , um you can have a button that activates menu . Or d or do we just integrate an an an scroll-wheel with a push-button . And then if the moment you use the scroll-wheel , the the the menu gets activated , and then you can scroll , choose an option , click on it , it goes into an feature . Click on it again , selects features , scroll , adjust it . Click again , it's okay . Then you only need one button to move back . Or or under each option , you set a {disfmarker} you set an a screen thing what says back , and you select that one , click again , and you go one step back . And in that menu , scroll , click , one step back . {vocalsound} So that then you need five buttons , and one integrated scroll-wheel push-button . Yep . Okay th that's {disfmarker} But we can't drop three buttons . Which {gap} {disfmarker} That's even {disfmarker} But I see that's {disfmarker} Yeah that's one Euro more expensive . Yeah . {vocalsound} So {gap} {disfmarker} {vocalsound} that's not a good idea . That's not an option . Because which buttons do we have now ? Those five which I mentioned , and then menu , and then {disfmarker} Menu , power . Yeah . F of the four things ? Four arrows ? Yeah , th power . Power . Uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Yeah , if you if you go to eight {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Which more ? I don't know how to {disfmarker} Yeah . Okay . So four arrows ? Yeah . Uh power I believe ? Power . Th Yeah that's five . {vocalsound} Uh {disfmarker} We have a Back and a Okay button . Yeah , okay that's seven , And the Menu . and one to activate the menu , yeah . So okay that's eight . Well we can't reduce that . We we keep the display . Yeah , and even if we drop three buttons from here , we still have to make some adjustments around here . So {disfmarker} Oh , well okay . Yeah . {vocalsound} Yeah , we need the chip for the for the L_C_ display . {vocalsound} The L_C_D_ ? Yeah . Let's make the {disfmarker} Let's make the case plastic . Yeah well we need the advanced {disfmarker} Then I rather make it wood . Instead of r Because then also it's good in the market with the forty five plus uh people . Yeah . Yeah . True . Yeah but but that's not our market . But {disfmarker} No that {disfmarker} maybe not . But maybe it's better than plastic anyway . Ah no , hard plastic . {vocalsound} Plastic with a with a special colour . {vocalsound} Oh . A woo wood uh wood uh wood colour . Yeah , plastic with special colour . Yeah ? {vocalsound} {vocalsound} No but I I {disfmarker} Yeah okay uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} That's an option . {vocalsound} Because we have to use the special colour anyway . You forgot that . Yeah . Yep . Yeah , yeah . So we do one one s {vocalsound} So let's go for the plastic . Yeah . Yeah , okay . Plastic . And since it's not kinetic , it doesn't have to flip around that much ? Uh that's easy because plastic is free . {vocalsound} Hmm . {vocalsound} Hmm . We still have problem of two Euros . Yeah , okay . Uh if we dropped uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} No the buttons , those are really needed . Yeah ? Yeah th th it's it's uh {disfmarker} Yeah we can't drop them . An advanced chip-on-print . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} You still need that . Yeah uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Do we really need that advanced chip for an L_C_D_ display ? You {disfmarker} uh uh {disfmarker} Yeah . So the other option would be to go for the the sample speaker , and {disfmarker} Which can use a regular chip , wh which is six Euros in total . {vocalsound} S That doesn't matter . Oh . I rather keep I rather keep the display . No , I keep the re Yeah . Yeah . Because we already designed for it . So {disfmarker} Well yeah . So the only option is an hand dynamo . Exactly . {vocalsound} Oh that {disfmarker} Yeah and something else . {vocalsound} Yeah but the {disfmarker} Oh no tha Oh that's one Euro , right . uh can't we f uh fit all the buttons in an intreg integrated scroll push-button ? 'Cause that will save us one and a half Euro already . And then if w And then integrated s Yeah but that would make it not so easy to use . No y you would rec I mean it's not that important , easy to use , but {disfmarker} Then you have {disfmarker} Th then we have to scroll through a lot of menus to be able to get where you want , huh ? Then you still need two additional buttons I believe . And uh {disfmarker} Yeah . For the volume . Yeah d at l Yeah . At least one for power . You can use those {disfmarker} Yeah . But the {disfmarker} Oh yeah and power . That's three buttons and this would cost {disfmarker} Oh . Yeah it's just as expensive as what we have now . But the integrated uh button ? How many func functions can it uh have ? Yeah . Three . Up , down , Okay . Yeah endlessly . I mean it can be a power button as soon as it powered on . Okay . You can go into you in you main menu , You you press it for like three seconds . you can choose uh flip channel , uh you can choose sound options , any options . Then then then you should do everything in the menu . On the screen . Yeah . Yeah , okay . It would save enough {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Maybe we should . 'Cause we don't have money and w we want the screen . Yeah you can choose this , drop these , then we have a half Euro left . Yeah . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} So we can maybe still use power button . {vocalsound} Yeah , but we'd {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Alright . Yeah . I guess we have to . It s it saves us four Euros and it costs us two and a half . So let's see , we we drop the price by one and a half . Yeah . You see ? We'll we'll be on {disfmarker} But we still have thirteen left . Oh still {disfmarker} Yeah ? Oh then I miscalculated . Oh yeah . Thirteen . So still half . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Shit . Drop the special colour . {vocalsound} There goes the special co {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Oh no . Well {disfmarker} {vocalsound} That would make it less appealing . So that's no option . {vocalsound} 'Kay . What else ? Uncurved ? No no , it has to be um curved . We sure about the advanced chip we need for the display ? Yeah . Yeah it says right here . {vocalsound} They made it very easy for us . {vocalsound} Okay . Well yeah . {vocalsound} {gap} yeah . We made it hard for ourselves with the display , but it's a cool feature . Ah , I don't think I can s uh persuade the management to say , this is better for the market so you sell more than {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Okay . Wh what we could do is um {disfmarker} drop the the special colour , and uh do the special colour for the buttons . {vocalsound} Yeah . Buttons . That's {disfmarker} Oh yeah since we only have one button . Yeah . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah but I mean what is meant by special colour ? I just m I don't {disfmarker} I think {disfmarker} Just something else than than black or white I think . Uh yeah it's {disfmarker} I think it's grey , regular . S yeah . Alright . Grey and rubber . But we definitely want the thing to be a special colour though . Of plastic . Yeah . Yeah . {vocalsound} Damn . So I rather have an hand dynamo {vocalsound} than than drop the colour . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah and then {vocalsound} {disfmarker} Yeah . Yeah yeah yeah yeah . You can still play with it then I guess . I don't know . Yeah . Yeah , but a hand dynamo costs a lot of energy to keep the screen working . So I guess that isn't an option . The display {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Well , you only have to power it up when you wanna use it . Yeah . The {disfmarker} But if you have to power the for ten minutes , {vocalsound} then the {disfmarker} Yeah . I don't know . {vocalsound} Yeah . No I don't think the current status of uh chips are pretty uh energy conserving , no . {gap} . Yeah . Yeah true . Yeah . Let's let's go for the hand dynamo then . Yeah hand dynamo ? Do you want an extra button ? {vocalsound} Or or do we {disfmarker} Or do we do uncurved and flat ? Instead of {disfmarker} {vocalsound} No no it has to be curved . Yeah . Yeah it has to be curved and has to have that colour . Yeah . Just put a special special colour of the buttons , or something . Yeah . And a screen . Yeah . That's the most import Yep ? Instead of an additional power button ? Yeah or spe special form ? Yeah . S what what is special f Oh yeah , special form . Yeah ? Maybe that's nicer . It's for scroll {disfmarker} Yeah . Without {disfmarker} But we don't have any buttons . We only have {disfmarker} {vocalsound} So do {disfmarker} Yeah . But it's it's for the integrated button , I think also . Or {disfmarker} d Uh make it a special colour then . Yeah but {disfmarker} Yeah ma make it a special colour then . Yeah but it's just a scroll-wheel which you can push down . So {disfmarker} Yeah . Okay . Yeah . Okay . Make it a special colour and then it look fancy . Yeah ? So {disfmarker} Yep . Woah we're within budget . {vocalsound} So {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} It's a miracle . {vocalsound} Oh just {disfmarker} Let's let's save it . oh ma make it two special colours , but we only have one button . Yeah . Okay . Let's do it like this , I mean , because it does not lose our identity of the product as we {disfmarker} Yeah ? {vocalsound} Okay . Um , well {disfmarker} {gap} . 'Kay , this was old . Well we come back to the drawing board then , huh ? {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} Okay . {vocalsound} Yeah all your designs are uh pretty much {disfmarker} Yeah back to work . Uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Did I save it ? It's silly 'cause we we should have had this meeting before we start drawing . Yeah . Yeah but that but that's the fun part of it . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} I I wanted to go , but I wasn't allowed . So {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Oh yeah ? {gap} okay . Alright . Uh I just forgot to save this . Just a minute . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {gap} . Yeah what's the next uh phase ? Yeah , this the last phase of course , so {disfmarker} Uh the agenda . By your humble P_M_ . Hmm . {vocalsound} Oh . {vocalsound} Oh f {vocalsound} Frustrated . {vocalsound} Alright . {vocalsound} Okay . Um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Yeah . Well we first should have had a uh prototype presentation . But well as you saw that hadn't made no sense , because we had to drop it . {vocalsound} Drop everything . Yeah . Drop , yeah . Uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} We went straight into finance ? {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah it was more important , so I just {vocalsound} Yeah . Yeah . For {disfmarker} Yeah . pushed up the agenda . Yeah . Uh , evaluation criteria . You have t produced something about that ? Yeah that that's {disfmarker} Yeah . I uh I sure did . And it combines with product evaluation . Uh so {disfmarker} Uh you put it in the {gap} . We all have to keep in mind what has changed now . So what we have left on the {disfmarker} Because evaluation is based on the initial uh user requirements . Yeah . Alright . F_ five . {vocalsound} Let's make it big . {vocalsound} Um {disfmarker} Well we evaluate uh the design with a seven point scale , as following . Well the remote controls according criteria blah blah blah . True or false , and then on a scale of seven points , a {gap} scale , as we all know it . Mm-hmm . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Um {disfmarker} Well the criteria are based on the user requirements , uh the trends from the marketing research , and the marketing strategy of the company itself . Um well they are in a Word document , which I will open now . Alt up {vocalsound} Yeah . I don't know it's open yet . No . And we all have to uh agree on a certain level . What's this ? {vocalsound} Freaky . {vocalsound} Oh . I don't know . Um {disfmarker} Well the first point is the remote control matches the operating behaviour of the young user . So that means the operating behaviour was using quite a lot of functions . How do you think about that ? {vocalsound} I think it does . Because the operating {gap} behaviour of the young user was also defined in colour and shape and the use of L_C_D_ , Yeah . right ? Uh , of course we dropped a little bit of those uh {disfmarker} Yeah the us u It it {disfmarker} Yeah . it's it's mainly con mainly concentrating on a lot of functions , in this question . Mm-hmm . So do you think {disfmarker} Well , we have extended menus , on the on the L_C_D_ screen . So {disfmarker} Yeah . You can you can ma Yep . Yeah , you can make a lot of extended menus . That's true . I mean the the possibilities are almost unlimited , to to build in menus in the screen . {vocalsound} I {gap} No . So on a scale from one to seven , what do you think ? Two or three . Two or three . Huh ? Two or three ? Something like that ? Two . Yeah . Well we have to choose one . So uh what do you say ? Uh y we should fill this in now . I agree on two . Yeah okay . Yeah . Uh {disfmarker} I uh I say two , personally . But {disfmarker} Yeah in the new design I s would say it's three . But now , in original design I say two . Yeah . Yeah alright . Yeah well we have to evaluate I guess what we have now . Okay then I say three . Yeah ? You say three , Yeah yeah . and you you said al also three ? Yeah . Three ? Okay well I say still two , but it has to be three then . {vocalsound} Hey , you're marketing , eh . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah I know . So it's made bold . But it's {disfmarker} nah , it's not very clear on the sc Hmm . M maybe underline . Or give it a colour . Maybe other colour , yeah . That's better . {vocalsound} Red . {vocalsound} Uh {disfmarker} Yeah . Alright . Oh , it doesn't have to be bold anymore . {vocalsound} Oh yeah very true . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Alright . Yeah . Yeah true one . {vocalsound} Um well the remote control has {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Wha {vocalsound} {vocalsound} He types everything . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Definitely one . It has to be . Yeah . {vocalsound} The remote control has irrelevant or less used functions . For example audio settings and screen settings . It hides uh basic functions . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Everything . {vocalsound} You don't use anything else . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah . Well , yeah . So it it's a very true point . I mean it hides all those function . {vocalsound} You're not gonna find them . Yeah . Yeah okay . Yeah . Yeah true . But , I mean uh they're hidden in the screen . If you don't want to use them , you don't s you s just scroll over them . And you place them {disfmarker} Mm-hmm . {vocalsound} F I don't know where . So that's very true , I guess , for our case . Yeah the next {disfmarker} Not so much so . Uh the second point . It shows the relevant and most used functions . Nope . Power button . Do we ha still have a power button ? Uh check with the Excel sheet . Well yeah the button's integrated , huh ? {vocalsound} I think we are {disfmarker} Yeah . Yeah it's uh it's integrated . Yeah we dropped it . You j you just push it in for {disfmarker} It's in {disfmarker} Oh yeah it was integrateds . Yeah . Yeah integrate it . Yeah just just push it in for th for three seconds or something , and then {disfmarker} Yeah . E exactly just like a m mobile . Yeah . I don't know . {vocalsound} Just go scrolling and it will activate . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah . Um it shows the relevant and most used functions . {vocalsound} {gap} . Yeah uh on the other {disfmarker} uh on one side I would say yes , and the other side I would say no . So it's {disfmarker} I don't know . It shows the most used functions and they are relevant , but {disfmarker} Can you uh change channels directly with with just one button ? Yeah . No , you have to scroll through the menu , before With the scroll butt Yeah and then say channel . And then {disfmarker} Yeah . So it's it's not {disfmarker} Well uh we should b build it so that if you don't kind of push into the menu or something , if {disfmarker} When it's on , yeah , it's turned on , You say you double click on the {disfmarker} Hmm ? It automatically has the the programme and the volume function , Yeah . but as soon as you click it you go into the menu or some {gap} {disfmarker} Of you {disfmarker} Yeah . Or you double click it . But but how do you change from volume to channel ? {vocalsound} No because it has four arrows , right ? No , not anymore . No . {vocalsound} No . {vocalsound} Because he's {gap} now have a scroll-wheel that you can push in . Oh yeah . Yeah . Like on the the mouse . Yeah I was thinking still about our uh integrated joystick . No we have n we have no buttons left . So {vocalsound} Say . the joystick was not an option . Yeah that is a bummer . So {disfmarker} {vocalsound} so you hav {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} So you you have to double-click , I mean , for , I mean , uh volume , To get into menu . Yeah . and three double click for the menu , or something . {vocalsound} Oh no . {vocalsound} Or hold it ten seconds . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} We'll make it a Morse code . {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} Yeah . Yeah . Alright . {vocalsound} But but ease of use was not very important , may I remind you . No no no . Uh it should be trendy . {vocalsound} So that's {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah but that that's not a question . {vocalsound} Uh the remote control shows the relevant and most used functions . {vocalsound} Well I think it's pretty much in the middle . Yeah . Four . You have to search for them in in the in the s in the screen , in the menu . So {disfmarker} Yeah , im {disfmarker} in the menu . Seven . {vocalsound} Yeah . So maybe it's more like a f a five . Or {disfmarker} Yeah . Five . Yeah I would go for five or six , yeah . Yeah . Five or six ? Five . Five . Yep . Okay five . Five ? Alright . Let's not diss our remote . {vocalsound} Yeah . It's the weirdest remote control I've ever seen . So {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Oh . {vocalsound} Yeah . Yep . Just one button . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Well it's different . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah . Alright . Uh the the remote control makes use of technolog technological innovation like L_C_D_ screen and speech recognition . But {disfmarker} Uh yep . Yeah . Well yeah but we dropped the speech recognition . But it has at least one innovation . Yeah , it's still {disfmarker} Yeah , I say two . Yeah . {vocalsound} We still have the fruit and vegetable print . I say two then . Oh , that's the next . {vocalsound} Yeah but {disfmarker} {vocalsound} that that's not that's not this question . Uh thi uh that's the other question . Fr Oh I mean the {disfmarker} Oh never mind . I'm a bit lost . {vocalsound} This one . I think a two . No . Two . Two yeah . {gap} . Yep . I think L_C_D_'s more useful than speech {disfmarker} Yeah definitely . What ? Oh not the bold one . It's way more practical , yeah . Right . Okay , it has a fancy look and feel by using fruit and vegetable prints , primary colours and sponge-like material . Yeah . {vocalsound} It should have been two questions . {vocalsound} I realise now , because {vocalsound} sponge-like material is dropped . {vocalsound} But the look and feel {disfmarker} You still have rubber d Or no . Yeah . So we still uh we still have the primary colours . But only on the on the outside , not on the button . No you got a plastic . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . The button has also colour . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah ? {vocalsound} The one button we have . {vocalsound} Okay . {vocalsound} Yeah . The one . Yeah . Yeah still we we dropped also on the the double uh curve . Yeah you could check with the Excel sheet . Mm mm . Yeah . You only have one {disfmarker} Yeah . Yeah we have single curve now , And and colour . and no and no material Yeah . S . So maybe in the middle or something . Yeah . Four . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah , I mean it's Yeah or three . {vocalsound} Uh {disfmarker} worth the {disfmarker} Yeah . We have something . Actually we d we didn't do so well on this one . Because it's basically an old one , uh with little curve on the side , and in a different colour . Still , it's still hard . Yeah . I mean the sponge-like and the three D_ shape , that would give it something young and fresh . New . Yeah . Yeah . But then we would have to drop the screen . Red . {vocalsound} Oh red . Yeah . You like both . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} I like bold . {vocalsound} Uh the remote control displays the corporate logo . {vocalsound} Um oh yeah . {vocalsound} Mm yeah yeah . {vocalsound} Of course . {vocalsound} I just couldn't {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} You just have to draw it . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Um , just one minute . It's the white part uh {disfmarker} Yeah but it {disfmarker} be because uh we couldn't hardly draw on the b s on the lower half of the screen , we could not make it big enough to actually draw in the {disfmarker} {gap} . Yeah . Yeah . So {disfmarker} We have a we have a {disfmarker} So I mean I wanted to put digits on the buttons as well . But {disfmarker} But there's uh enough space for the corporate logo . I mean , {vocalsound} if there's only one thing . Hell yeah . If we have only one button . Yeah . So I will say that is very true . {gap} . Mm-hmm . And even the shape we have now uh simulates kind of an R_ and the reversed R_ , {vocalsound} doesn't it ? {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} So {disfmarker} {vocalsound} The remote control is easy to use . Well I would say {disfmarker} {vocalsound} No . Skill , uh I would say six , or something . I don't think it's easy to use , or not so . {vocalsound} The only e the only thing easy about it is that you don't have to move your fingers . 'Cause it has only one button . Ah i Yeah . And that you only have to control one button . {vocalsound} Yeah exactly . {vocalsound} Yeah . It it it has a nice screen . But {disfmarker} Yeah . It gives visual feedback . So {disfmarker} Yeah . Well I I would say a five or a six . I think a five . Five . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} I would say six . What do you say ? Easy to use ? Five or a six ? It's really not easy to use . {vocalsound} No not anymore . {vocalsound} 'Cause you're putting everything {disfmarker} So a six , more . Yeah . Yeah , uh I would go for the six too . So {disfmarker} Okay . Yeah . Most votes count . Um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Um well , another question , Yeah that looks uh great . uh the remote control is durable . {vocalsound} I don't know if that's the correct word . Yeah . Nah {disfmarker} Definitely in casing , 'cause we have a hard plastic But uh {disfmarker} In use , both battery as casing ? {disfmarker} Yeah . Yeah because the the batteries , those thingies last forever . Yeah ? True , true . And the the casing , hard plastic also lasts forever . And the casing is plastic , {gap} ? Yep . Yeah . If you don't drop it too much , it's uh should last pretty long . Yeah . So I would go for one . Yeah ? But uh I think rubber compared is better . So I think a two is more appropriate Yeah . S {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yep . Okay yeah . than {disfmarker} Wow . {vocalsound} Yeah . Logo . {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} Okay I will go {disfmarker} go for two . {vocalsound} Uh the last one ? The remote control's a good example for company's motto , we put the fashion in electronics . {vocalsound} Oh . No m No we put the electronics into the fashion . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah well {disfmarker} yeah . {vocalsound} I would g {vocalsound} {gap} uh {disfmarker} {gap} turn around . Yeah . But um {disfmarker} I would go for four . No {disfmarker} Yeah ? Because we kind of tried to but we kind of failed with the budget that we have . It's not {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Yeah , true . Yeah okay . So a four . It's {disfmarker} {vocalsound} it g it g goes , it's not the best we could do , I guess . Yeah . But it all has to do with the budget , because it's it's not the bad idea we had , so {disfmarker} Yeah . Yeah yeah . Yeah , four is okay . Alright , yeah . Right . So {disfmarker} That's it . So if I understood it right , we have to count these numbers . Ooh . And {disfmarker} Yeah ? What ? Uh {disfmarker} Yeah . Mm-hmm . Oh {disfmarker} Yeah . Oh {disfmarker} Alright . Word document , the {disfmarker} Yeah . That {disfmarker} Yeah we have to count them . Count them . Add them ? Or {disfmarker} Uh {disfmarker} Yeah just add them and then uh divide them . Could somebody start calculator ? {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah . Mm . {vocalsound} Ah we can do the math . Uh {disfmarker} I all made it po I I all made it {vocalsound} I all made it possible uh for a positive questions , so we can count it . Mm-hmm . I mean if you have reversed question , you have to reverse the scale , Yeah , yeah . You have to {disfmarker} uh {disfmarker} Yes . 'Kay . So four and {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Yeah . Did you make this questionnaire or what ? Yeah . {vocalsound} Thanks . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Nice work . Okay . Oh . Three plus ? {vocalsound} I wouldn't be able to do it that fast . O one . Plus one . Plus five . Plus five ? {vocalsound} Oh {disfmarker} Easy . Bo {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Question number four , yeah ? Uh two . Yeah . {vocalsound} Four . Oh . Wait a second . Oh . {vocalsound} F {vocalsound} It's it's gone wrong . {vocalsound} How hard is it ? Okay . It's your turn . Pretty difficult . {vocalsound} Yeah just use {disfmarker} Start over ? No it's if you press twice on the plus button , then you get s s Oh there tho uh there's no n There's no num pads . You can {disfmarker} Oh yeah . {vocalsound} No . That's why it's uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} It's a it's a bit uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Just type in the digits . They're all one digit numbers right ? And then you can count them together . Yeah . I think you can just count them by a {disfmarker} Just count it to {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Yeah . Um let's move over . Okay . Three , four , nine . Three , plus one , four . Nine . Uh {disfmarker} Uh , yeah . Are you here ? Eleven . Eleven . Eleven , Fifteen . Fifteen . fifteen . Sixteen . Sixteen . Sixteen , yeah . Seventeen . Seventeen . No sixteen . Uh sixteen plus six . Oh what ? Twenty two . {vocalsound} S Uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} How hard is this ? {vocalsound} Twenty two . Twenty two , yeah ? Twenty four . Twenty six . Never mind . Twenty four . Twenty eight . Tw Oh , sorry . {gap} . Twenty {disfmarker} Twenty eight . That was the last one . That was that . {vocalsound} Oh my . Twenty eight . Yeah . Okay . Twenty eight . So divided by nine . Twen Uh okay . By nine . Hmm . That's uh three uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Or le less than a three . So {disfmarker} Yeah the lower the {disfmarker} The lower the score the better , right ? Yeah . Yeah . Twenty eight Yeah but {disfmarker} Divided by nine . di divided by nine So thr t two . makes three point one one one one one one one . So we're better than average . But {disfmarker} Yeah . {vocalsound} I Are you sure we {disfmarker} this number actually tells us somethings ? No . {vocalsound} I don't think so because some questions are related to positive issues and some to negative . {vocalsound} Some questions are {disfmarker} Yeah . So if you give a true to a positive , it actually means that the low {disfmarker} the lower the better . But if you give true to a negative question {disfmarker} Yeah , but there are no negative questions I guess . No ? Good example . Durable use . Durable , that's good . Easy to use . This {gap} is good . Easy to use . {vocalsound} Fancy look and feel , that's good . Yeah . {gap} . Technology innovation was good , because of a marketing uh requirement . Also good . Yeah okay . Re relevant most used function . I guess you did do it . And hides these functions . {vocalsound} That was also a good thing . Oh yeah . Yeah . Oh yeah yeah . No {disfmarker} And then matches the opera of the {gap} user was also a good thing . Yeah . Okay . Okay . So it were all positive questions , by uh by purpose . So {disfmarker} Yeah true . Yes , so the {disfmarker} It tells us something , yes . Becau But the picture would be a lot different if we didn't have to drop those uh those things , I guess . Oh great . Things , yeah . Yeah definitely definitely . Okay . Because now it's just an average {disfmarker} It's remote . Yeah . Nah it it's it's better than average , but {disfmarker} Yeah okay because of the L_C_D_ screen . But uh it looks and stuff , it still uh {disfmarker} Yeah . So th It's still {disfmarker} yeah . Yeah . Has some shortcomings . it's not , it's not really eye-catching , except for the colour . No . {vocalsound} The colour and the screen . Yeah . {vocalsound} Okay so {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Um this we had , this we had . We have to do a product evaluation . Product evaluation . {vocalsound} Uh prototype presentation we dropped . So {disfmarker} Uh the finance we looked . We have redesigned . Uh not on that , but {disfmarker} Yeah we we have to maybe if we have to redesign it on this {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} So you can just make one big L_C_D_ screen . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Okay it's your turn now . {vocalsound} Shall we try ? {vocalsound} With some casing around it , yeah . Black . Okay uh we're still gonna go for the fancy colours ? Yeah uh {disfmarker} Yeah . But are we gonna stick with the green or are we gonna do blue ? Yeah . Yeah we we can just uh use this one . And then uh over-paint it with uh uh the green uh {disfmarker} The the button has a special colour , the frame has a special colour . Yeah . he only needs one button . One scroll button and {disfmarker} It's plastic . {vocalsound} And single curved . Yeah . Or we have to delete this one or {disfmarker} Yeah . Oh and you might want to add a uh infrared LED . {vocalsound} Oh {disfmarker} oh no . {vocalsound} Oh yeah . {vocalsound} Otherwise it uh doesn't function uh so well . For what ? Okay . Yeah . {vocalsound} So that's {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Do we have to do other things ? Well I have to um um make an uh report of every decision we made so far . Or just redesign ? {vocalsound} Alright . And I try to get chip just before uh I uh receive the Excel sheet . Yeah . So I {disfmarker} So you made a start , right ? Yeah I'm I'm somewhere , but maybe you can help me . Should give it some time ? Yeah . Yay . Uh {disfmarker} Okay , but how do we make the the scroll uh button ? I was here . So {disfmarker} It's just one {disfmarker} Have to take this away also . Alright . yeah . Ah {disfmarker} {vocalsound} And this um {disfmarker} Uh that's the infrared uh {vocalsound} thing . {vocalsound} Oh yeah , of course . The the target group has a weak spot for fruit and vegetables , like primary colours , spongy shape . Yeah . Um pen yeah ? Format . Current colour red . The playfulness , we decided to use kinetic energy as a power sour Oh {disfmarker} Yeah we did our special colour for the {disfmarker} Yeah . Okay . Line widths , now that's a ten . That's conceptual , yes . That's enough to get started with , so {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah . Um , uh it's just a scroll {disfmarker} Mm . It's gonna be one str scroll . Yeah , is it's horizontal or vertical ? How many pages ? {vocalsound} Uh , I just took one for every step and then a conclusion . I think {disfmarker} Alright . Y you have you have done the first two . Horizontal's easier too , Yeah . 'cause you can {disfmarker} Okay , and and the look and feel is {disfmarker} Yeah . Is it more natural than this ? Well I think I have to make a p an issue called finance . Yeah , yeah . So let's say {disfmarker} Whoops . 'Kay . Yeah . Yes . Basically . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} It doesn't look like uh {disfmarker} The items we had to drop . {vocalsound} Yeah . Uh it {disfmarker} it's it's not {disfmarker} Yeah . It's not very fashionable anymore . But uh it's okay . It's really ugly . Yeah . Where did we start with price ? Maybe m make it bigger ? Or {disfmarker} Twenty six and a half . Mm-hmm . {vocalsound} Or not ? Or twenty six ? Something like that . Yeah . That looks little bit more uh {disfmarker} Maybe that's a s a special colour for it . So we can make it uh special ? {vocalsound} Oh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} This ? What do you mean ? Like a other colour than this one ? {vocalsound} Or or speckles in it ? I dunno . Uh {disfmarker} Speckles ? {vocalsound} Yeah can we do it uh {disfmarker} uh can we do a print ? ..$ I'm not sure . ... . I don't think so , if you see the options . But {disfmarker} I think we have to choose , yeah ? Uh {disfmarker} Okay special colour . We do have special colour . Yeah red is already a special colour , I think . So {disfmarker} Does it mean uh that {disfmarker} {vocalsound} It's not very special , but uh {disfmarker} Yeah . {vocalsound} Shall we just give it some dots to make it look pretty ? Yeah . Just uh put the purple uh purple on it . {vocalsound} Purdy . Yeah . Some some big dots . Purple ? That's trendy . Yeah yeah . Yeah . Oh no my remote has acne . ... . We have the original balance sheet , or {disfmarker} Yeah . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah . Woah . No . That's why we have that button . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Oh yeah . It's so cute . Hmm . Oh what ? Doh . Woah . {gap} ? {vocalsound} Just cut . Control Z_ . Oh no . {vocalsound} Is that that ? {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah . No no . Yeah . {vocalsound} Yeah . How the {disfmarker} We {disfmarker} did we do that ? Oh it's it's just one computer ? Or {disfmarker} Just dual screen . {vocalsound} No . But can we delete it , just with delete ? Or {disfmarker} We can try . {vocalsound} That doesn't respond also to the undo . It looks like it's {disfmarker} Crashed . {vocalsound} Oh , no . No , {gap} {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Very nice . Okay . {vocalsound} Where do you want some more dots ? {vocalsound} Yeah , over here . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} You can't even draw anymore . Hmm ? {vocalsound} Yeah . Y y you you {vocalsound} What's this ? Even children can draw . {vocalsound} you push the button or something . Or {disfmarker} Can you just push pen and then keep on {disfmarker} Oh yeah . Oh that's the select button . Hmm . It's uh {disfmarker} Okay , it's not the prettiest , I know . No , it looks {disfmarker} It's not so random huh ? Lot of options . {vocalsound} It's okay . Specially the the R_ . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah , the R_ and another R_ . Yeah okay . It's called the Real Remote , right ? Yeah . Maybe maybe it c it can say that . The Real Remote . Yeah just on the the m um the L_C_D_ display . {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} Welcome . {vocalsound} This is your Real Remote . {vocalsound} We can make a l a logo . {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} Yeah . Like uh {gap} put it like the shape . Yeah . D designed by {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Something like that . Okay . I mean it's not too uh {disfmarker} That's not their logo , is it ? No . Do they have a lo {disfmarker} Oh , the {disfmarker} here . This i this is the logo . Yeah . Two R_s and a one {disfmarker} It's a {disfmarker} Yeah . You can just reuse that , because the name is the same . Initials . {gap} . {vocalsound} You can copy and paste the picture if you want . How {gap} {disfmarker} Shall we do the logo in black or not ? Mm . Yeah . Yeah . {vocalsound} What is that ? Look more {disfmarker} Looks more like a campfire . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Are you dissing my drawing ? {vocalsound} This one ? Yeah . {vocalsound} It looks like a ribbon . {vocalsound} {gap} . Yeah . Okay . So who wants to draw ? This is actually quite fun . Do we need to do anything ? Are we uh ready ? Uh {disfmarker} Or {disfmarker} I hear you people are typing . Type in your report . Oh , okay . I don't see any new messages . So {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Luckily . Hmm ? Luckily , yeah . Is this uh the last assignment ? Or {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah , it's uh Final {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {disfmarker} Yeah . It's almost four . What time do we have to deliver the report ? Four o'clock or {disfmarker} {vocalsound} At four , yeah , {gap} ? Or before that ? Okay . And copy this . Just compare uh {disfmarker} Just a minute . This is really bizarre . It's {disfmarker} It looks like there's a {disfmarker} It looks like a butterfly . Um bug . Bug . It's somewhere {disfmarker} I d It isn't inside . No it's in inside the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Yeah , and don't know how it's {disfmarker} or eject it . No it's on the on the beamer I guess . No it {disfmarker} Oh . {vocalsound} From up there ? No , but it i It's not a bu a beamer . No . B It's a normal T_V_ screen , kind of thing . Yeah it's somewhere in here . Hey , you've got it uh read only . So you have to uh {disfmarker} Save copy . Yeah . Strange . This something what's projection from behind , I guess . Yeah . {vocalsound} {gap} . {gap} . It's too uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Oh . Yeah there is some kind of projection I think . Yes . Yeah it it's a beamer , but then with a {disfmarker} With a with a mirror , huh ? Or something . within a mirror , yeah . {gap} {vocalsound} {gap} . Yeah . So it looks like a big screen , but {gap} {disfmarker} in fact it isn't . So are we gonna change anything to this ? It is {disfmarker} I mean is it gonna {disfmarker} Well it's it's single single curved . Well {disfmarker} {vocalsound} It's now single curved . So {disfmarker} It's flat . Oh no . This is gonna be flat . Yeah exactly . Th this is flat . Yeah . {vocalsound} Okay . It doesn't matter . It's it's {vocalsound} {disfmarker} But it's it's better to have in the front , this kind of shape , because it looks nice . {vocalsound} I mean you see more of this than of that . Yeah . Yeah , more like that . Yeah . And this is also gonna be {disfmarker} {vocalsound} It's not very uh ideal . {vocalsound} Nope . Do like this . But sometimes then uh all of a sudden it does work . Yeah . What's this ? {vocalsound} That's the detector uh for the {disfmarker} Ooh . {vocalsound} Okay . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Maybe {disfmarker} But I don't see a detector over there . Yeah . I don't know . {vocalsound} No it's {disfmarker} I think you only need two points . Or not . No , you sh I thought it was a kind of thing to put it on , and then draw right lines or something . Maybe that's why it's it's not working , because it's more {disfmarker} Slanted yeah . {vocalsound} Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . {vocalsound} Or just messed it up . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Well maybe . Oh . {vocalsound} Oh yeah . {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} Yeah it it matters for the aim of this thing . Yeah . Yeah but it wasn't good . {vocalsound} You've to make it s uh ninety degrees . Yeah it it has to touch the corners , I guess . But th this one wasn't good , because if I was drawing here , I drew a line and then it came over here . {vocalsound} Um now you probably have to recalibrate . You have {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Oh , five minutes to the end of the meeting . Oh we're always long . Oh . {vocalsound} And the recalibration is done using this icon here . Yeah , can we t can we get to that @ i Ooh . {vocalsound} Oh it's not working anymore . {vocalsound} Yeah well I just {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Yeah yeah , it's it's okay . It's working again . {vocalsound} Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah , it's it's working , it's working . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Okay . Yeah . {vocalsound} {gap} {disfmarker} Yeah . It's better than before . We're improving uh {disfmarker} Yeah . Yeah . You go ahead . Yeah . Yeah that's improved uh pretty much . Yeah it's only a bit like to that side , but that is that one by the way . Yeah . Yeah but it's better , it's better {disfmarker} No it {disfmarker} 'Cause this one makes the angle either like this . So i if I change this , it will go there , if I change that , will go there . Mm . No . It's better than it was I guess . Mm-hmm . I will take this away 'cause it looks messy . {vocalsound} Silly . Yeah . Works pretty well . Five minutes before the meeting's over . Yeah . Yeah . And then ? Then I have to uh uh write this , We have to present {disfmarker} and I don't know if you have to present , because I didn't receive any information about that so far . Alright . Maybe we will . Maybe we get a a final mail . So it {disfmarker} after the {disfmarker} after after these five minutes , you have to {disfmarker} Yeah . {vocalsound} Yeah , I have still ten minutes to finish the report . What's this anyway ? So cake . {vocalsound} Alright . After after that five minutes , you have ten minutes to finish it , or {disfmarker} It looks like candle wax . Yeah . Alright . And we uh {disfmarker} And you can uh just uh relax and uh have cup of coffee or {disfmarker} Right . Chill . {vocalsound} oh no , they don't have beer here so you can't celebrate . Huh . You can just if you ma finish my presentation please . Uh over there . Uh {disfmarker} Yeah ? The presentation is still open . So if you finish that then you'll see uh {disfmarker} Yeah next . Next slide . Oh yeah , we have to do the project uh evaluation . Just uh do that quickly . Yeah ? Uh {disfmarker} How do you do it ? Uh well basically what that says , we discuss it and um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Alright . So how were {disfmarker} did the project process uh go ? Did you , were you all pleased with the process as it was ? Or are there uh {disfmarker} Uh th uh do you mean the the interaction between us ? Or {disfmarker} Yeah the interaction and the steps we followed , and and so forth . Yeah well at first I was really stressed . Because it went a bit fast . {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} But then as I knew the tempo that I had to be on , the second time I think I did a bit better . Yeah . Yeah . And the third time yeah , I mean {disfmarker} And we move more to to working together as team , No . Mm-hmm . because at first you you make your individual contribution , and then come here , and you have no idea what the others have to make . {vocalsound} {gap} . No . Yeah , yeah yeah yeah . And then finally you have some idea , okay this is gonna w this is what we gonna make together and okay I will arrange this and you will arrange that , Mm-hmm . and you have a k a kind of idea what you can expect on the next half hour when you have to work on your own . So {disfmarker} Yeah . Yeah we {disfmarker} The process , I mean , the interaction between us became better and better I guess . Mm-hmm . Yeah . Especially after the first meeting . Mm-hmm . And {disfmarker} Yeah , especially if f f if you see {disfmarker} uh you se you saw the largest difference from the first to the second meeting I guess . Yeah . Yeah . Definitely . Okay and was that due to my leadership ? {vocalsound} Yeah yeah yeah . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Well you did become more assertive the the second time round , so that {disfmarker} Yeah ? Yeah . Yeah . You were more in charge kind of thing . That okay ? Yeah . {vocalsound} Okay . Um was there uh enough room for creativity ? I guess so . Yeah . Yeah but only the the financial parts uh {disfmarker} I mean {disfmarker} Li Limiteded afterwards , Yeah . but {disfmarker} If if you don't take that into account , there's plenty of room for creativ creativity . I Also not only the drawing and the the making of the thing itself , but also in explaining it to the other people , by means of uh We were pretty democratic . the the board and uh PowerPoint and Word and stuff like that . So and the {disfmarker} uh about the board {gap} digital pen ? Uh was that helpful or {disfmarker} Yeah . Ooh . Mm uh I think in in essence {vocalsound} the digital pen is better than the SMARTboard . Because it it it just works better . Yeah it works . {vocalsound} I mean uh uh I've made {disfmarker} yeah , uh I've made several notes just to test it , and and just put the pen in into it , and then it came onto my screen and it looked perfectly . Yeah . So it it's better a better device than uh Mm-hmm . {vocalsound} Maybe {disfmarker} Yeah . than the screen . But the screen is useful , in essence , but it doesn't work that well . {vocalsound} It's uh it's {disfmarker} The the pen is more intuitive , 'cause we're all used to writing with pen . {vocalsound} Use the pen . And uh as I said , uh I uh have no idea how PowerPoint works , so will take me half a day to be able to make a normal PowerPoint presentation . {vocalsound} Yeah . But once I get to know the program probably , I mean , it looks better , you know . Or uh something like that . You can give it a kind of a home style , like we have i the the logo and everything . Yeah yeah . And {disfmarker} I don't know . Yep . Blink . Oh . {vocalsound} Warning . Finish meeting now . Finish meeting . Okay , are are there {vocalsound} any new ideas about this ? All I think {disfmarker} Well , it {disfmarker} I didn't really receive , yeah . It's use especially useful , I guess , to to evaluate designs and graph graphical stuff . {vocalsound} Uh uh w uh {disfmarker} And and S sorry uh {disfmarker} the {gap} screen and stuff like that . Mm-hmm . I think the PowerPoint is is too limited . You can't uh draw easy in in PowerPoint . It has to be uh {disfmarker} yeah . The drawing board has to be integrated into PowerPoint , so that you can just easily {disfmarker} Yeah . {vocalsound} Yeah the the the problem with PowerPoint for me is that you have to i put in the pre-made chunks c as well . Yeah . Yeah . You know , you can draw something on the sketch-board and then take it there , or whatever . Yeah . Yeah . But it it's useful to to show something to to an {disfmarker} a small audience , and then to {disfmarker} Yeah just for text , for text it's uh it's okay . But {disfmarker} Yeah . These these kind of screens this size are useful to discuss things . So {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Oh . {vocalsound} Yes . Check your email . Uh we should uh enter our questionnaire . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {gap} {vocalsound} You also . {vocalsound} 'Kay . Ah . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Woah . Alright . Right . Okay . Uh okay . Okay . Alright . Yes boss . Well , s see you in a second huh ? {gap} . That's the management . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Well see you soon . Oh . Hope so . Okay . {vocalsound} Yeah . Um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Yeah {vocalsound} we have to pull it this way , huh ? Wait .",
        "summarize": "The meeting began with the harsh budget problem that the group had to cut down something of the current conceptual remote control, otherwise they would be unable to handle the cost. They talked about reducing the buttons, integrating functions, or using cheaper materials. After the discussion, the Marketing offered a questionnaire for the group to check if they were on the right track. Through the questionnaire, they found that it would be better if they paid more attention to the external design so the Industrial Design embellished the current design on the color and logo. As the last thing left to the meeting, the group reviewed their cooperation and got a general plan of their coming group presentation."

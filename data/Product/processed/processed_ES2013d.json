        "transcript": "{vocalsound} Um almost , there's one more thing I have to get out of the {disfmarker} I have to make sure that this attachment will open . {vocalsound} I keep forgetting whether I've done this . {gap} . Ah-ha . Okay . We'll open that when the time is right . In the meantime {disfmarker} Closing things down , okay . Let's see what this thing does . Does it come up together or disappear one of them or what ? Ah , we came up together , we're good . Okay . Are we ready to start ? Okay . It's now quarter of four . This is a f another forty minute one so it will end at four twenty five . Okay . Right . Our agenda is , as before , for me to open the meeting , for us to go over the previous minutes , then for the two of you to present your prototype and for you to g um Sarah present the evaluation criteria . We then have a finance aspect , which is a spreadsheet , an Excel spreadsheet . And I know what you're all thinking of , oh my , um because we're only given a forty minute time period to get it all in , including the production evaluation . So we're going to make a very fast track . Okay . Um and as you can see that's what we do next on this thing . So the first thing I have to do is close this so that I can get to {disfmarker} Where is it ? {vocalsound} Red . I need to open mine . Not the agenda . Agenda three . No that th I want the minutes from the previous {disfmarker} minutes . Mm . That should be there , minutes . Yeah . Okay . Uh from meeting three , is it alright with you if I don't switch it to show , just use it as is ? 'Cause this way I can more easily flip it . Okay , um obviously all of us were here for the last meeting , we reviewed the previous minutes before that , um each of you made your presentations . {vocalsound} Um we discussed the various possibilities based on what was presented in those presentations . The market trend of fruit and veg , mm spongy , uh fancy and elegant more than technologically innovative and that more than easy . Um we decided chip on print would be used . Um we would use plastic with a rubber casing , I think was the consensus , powered by kinetic energy . There was no decision made on the curvatures or double curvature or straight . Um perhaps the prototype will give us an inkling of that . Um looking like a scroll , but it's really a push button technology , excuse my spelling um that was actually in use , that is uh behind the scenes is push button which we uh according to Kate have a very good uh grasp on doing that in production . Um we decided that separate fashionable covers covering your fruit and veg might be a separate product that could be suggested to management . Um and as suggested um yellow with black buttons with the company logo , a slogan and image might be a good idea based on the requirements that have been provided to us . Um we did have a few production issues and coordination of the various bits and we had some conflict of ideas and cost constraints and we ran out of time . Um we had to follow that up and prepare for the last one . And uh we closed as it ran out of time . Is that a fair presentation of what happened ? Yep . Yes . Okay , back to this meeting . Um we're down to the prototype presentation . Ta-da . Alright . Over to you . Right . Well . Ooh , two . Yeah , well you see , each made one , we didn't have enough yellow dough . Ah . {vocalsound} This is the one that I made . Uh-huh . It is uh curved , easy to hold , hand-held , nice and small with big easy buttons . This is like a scroll , but they are push buttons and they enter {disfmarker} takes you into the different menus . Of course we need someone who's experienced with the television {gap} . I mean this is the infrared thing that's gonna zap at the television . Uh I'm not quite sure how to make that , but I'm sure it will work . Uh this is on off switch , 'cause I think we do need that , and I think it gives it a nice balance . 'Kay . And it's gonna have the logo imprinted on it uh in there . Okay . Um as for what it's actually made of {disfmarker} well the function of these buttons is up , down , left and right {vocalsound} in the different menus . Okay . Uh position , I presume that just means right right on it , easy to see . The main feature of it is just a simple design , simple , lack of uh buttons all over the place . Right ? {vocalsound} Form curved , kind of smooth , hand-held , makes it feel nice to hold . Uh material , I think Kate's gonna tackle that quite a bit , but I think we have two different options , because we did make a another one , which wa uh is in the shape of banana , it's just {disfmarker} if you can imagine this as yellow with black buttons , like just like this but in the shape of a banana , Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . which is also nice and easy to hold and feels good and has a similar sort of scroll push button technology , just a slightly different design . {vocalsound} Also with on off switch and infrared {disfmarker} {vocalsound} uh I had envisioned it in hard smooth plastic . So like uh {disfmarker} well , I dunno , what's it like ? I guess like an existing remote control , but molded and smooth . Whereas otherwise we'd thought , like with this one {disfmarker} or mix and match , just we were gonna see what you thought , the {disfmarker} uh a more spongy rubber cover with spongy buttons . So we have the two options we can follow , either the smooth hard plastic or the spongy rubber , depending on cost restraints . And what we well , what conclusion we reach when we discuss it . {vocalsound} Uh material {disfmarker} yeah , that's what I have to say about material . Can I scroll down on there and see what else {disfmarker} Mm-hmm . Well colour , I think {disfmarker} I definitely have a preference towards bright yellow with black buttons , because that's the company colours , but if anybody's got any other suggestions , I'm quite willing to consider them as well . {vocalsound} So , it just depends what you think about these ideas and if I'm {disfmarker} yeah , maybe , Kate , you better say what you think about them . Um well I don't have very much to add . Um the the case {disfmarker} oops , that's the uh on off button just come off our prototype . {vocalsound} The the case can be either um spongy rubber or hard plastic . We're not absolutely sure about a combination of the two , but it can be either of those . We have the technology to do that . Um and as for the the actual components um , uh Steph just said this is a {disfmarker} quite a cheap device to manufacture . We have simple rubber push buttons um which provide all the functionality we need . Um the um {vocalsound} the diode that actually does the um infrared is at the end , it's the stalk of the banana , or it's just the thing at the end of this version . Um so that's for material . Colour , well uh Steph's the expert on colour . Um we we don't have any particular restrictions on that . Yeah , I think that's all we've got to say really . I thin as for as for the fruit or organic theme , I guess this one is obviously fruit shaped . A banana . This one has n banana , yeah . This one has no obvious connections to fruit , but because it's round and molded , it kinda makes you think sort of organic , touchy-feely , kiddie , it's more like {disfmarker} yeah , you'd expect it to be like a child's sorta toy remote control instead of a real one , which I quite like that sort of image . 'Cause it's very big and chunky and child-friendly and {vocalsound} Would you care to examine the prototypes , see how they feel in the hand ? {vocalsound} Hold them , you see , you know . Curvature , is it to your liking ? Oh I see , the on-off's in the back . Yes , that's so that your index finger automatically goes straight to it . {vocalsound} If you don't wanna tire out your thumbs after all . And then you can use your thumb . {vocalsound} And it was partly we thought the design looked better , Yeah . {gap} I could see this thing , unless it's reinforced , having a problem with the you know {disfmarker} Breaking , yeah . oh right . {vocalsound} Well you see , that's why hard plastic would be quite a good thing for it , because then it'd just be rigid . I like the fact that on both of them the keys play such a prominent role . Hmm . Yeah , {gap} we really like we really like that design , It's really kind of a {disfmarker} I mean it looks just like a logo , that arrangement of the keys . Like a c like a compass point , you know , Mm-hmm mm-hmm . just up , down , left and right , and we think we could make that quite a good feature . And it's like the the iPod scroll wheel , {vocalsound} but better . Yeah . But it's also like texting , Yeah . Yeah , yeah , you don't {disfmarker} Hmm . I mean it {disfmarker} that's what it makes me think of , mobile phones , {vocalsound} {vocalsound} I was try I was thinking , moving your thumb like this , what does that remind me of ? And it's a very simple design , Yeah . It's texting . there's not a lot to wrong , the components are cheap to make . It's also in terms of um being lost it's it's quite {disfmarker} it looks quite different . Hmm . You know , I I d I have several {disfmarker} four remotes , and they all look the same until you get up close and you have to {disfmarker} Yeah . you know , this is really identifiable . {vocalsound} I mean the thing is we do need to develop our technology of {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I mean actually how to program the menus and what sort of , you know , text box is gonna appear at the bottom of the screen , Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . but we do definitely think that it's a viable option . Okay . The next item is evaluation . No , okay . Uh if that's {disfmarker} if you're finished . {vocalsound} Uh yeah , we're finished . Um {disfmarker} Mm-hmm . shall I take your uh power ? Oh sorry . Oh . {vocalsound} Try again . Okay . This is going to be a heavily interactive evaluation , and the method here is to evaluate the new remote control in terms of the user requirements and the hot trends introduced by the marketing department . So , this means we're going to go over the priorities that were raised by uh the consumers a as well as incorporate all of our insight into this uh evaluation exercise . So I'm going to go and use the whiteboard , and I've made a list of criteria to look at , and so I'm gonna I'm gonna leave this up as the last thing , but for the evaluation it's going to be one is true and seven is false , going over these different criteria , so one true seven false and I'm gonna now use the um the board . Okay . So um fancy , technologically innovative , easy to use , trendy , buttons , excess buttons , good buttons , ugly , sellable , and other . And in fact I hope that uh you all introduce some additional terms , because these are things that um have been brought up , some of them seem rather close , Yeah , what about price , is that gonna go on there as well ? Price of materials . like they overlap . Mm , yeah , price . Hmm . We'll put price up at the top . {vocalsound} Not that we actually know anything about it , {vocalsound} but we can we can pretend . {vocalsound} Well we will soon , unfortunately . Um Okay , so {disfmarker} Come on . Did you say {gap} ? No , {gap} . Uh okay , so wha how do we feel in terms of is this fancy ? It depends what what you mean by fancy really , 'cause when I think of fancy , I think of it's got lots of extra sort of fripperies and , you know , like baroque curliness and {disfmarker} which {vocalsound} Mm-hmm . I'd call these quite uh minimalist , Yes , a plain , simple , clean design . simple and plain , but I mean I do see what {disfmarker} {vocalsound} it is heavily reliant on appearance instead of pure functionality , Mm-hmm . so in that respect it is quite fancy . {vocalsound} I {disfmarker} yeah , so in that respect {disfmarker} I think we'll go with that respect . I think just maybe we need a different word other than fancy , I'd say maybe aesthetic . Yeah . {vocalsound} Well we have got s trendy further down , Elegant . but {disfmarker} Elegant . Elegant . Elegant , I don't know if I'd call them elegant . Yeah , no these aren't the exact terms that the um {disfmarker} {gap} like stylish or aesthetic . Stylish , yeah . Yeah . Elegant . We're gon let's use elegant , although the the the people , the word on the street is is {vocalsound} {disfmarker} Fancy . Yeah . {vocalsound} N that {disfmarker} um Did you just break the pen ? {vocalsound} yeah uh {disfmarker} the uh {disfmarker} is fancy . So let's let's take it to the next level . Well d we'll just call it fancy then . Well okay , so in terms of elegant , fancy . we'll call it E_F_ um , do we do we think that perhaps {disfmarker} and maybe we should say the yellow ? Should we go with the yellow in terms of {disfmarker} I think that's a really superior {disfmarker} Yeah , I think we n we need to {disfmarker} they're both {disfmarker} they're both yellow with black buttons , it's just that we didn't have any more dough to represent uh that , Yeah . Mm . but if you can just imagine banana shape with these bits as black . Yeah . So what we re really need to decide is whether we want the actual banana shape or just a a purely blob or some sort of abstraction in between the two Yeah . that isn't {disfmarker} that is more curved , like a banana , but that isn't actually recognisable as a banana , you know , with the grooves and the stalk and stuff , As a banana . so . I think that many of us are abstract enough to look at the yellow one and say we'll call it the banana . Yeah . And of the two I really like I m I like the banana , The chunk . but I I do like the chunk . So that's maybe not something we have to decide just right now , is it . No , Just somewhere a long the scale of in between these two . but I mean in terms {disfmarker} we have to evaluate one of them . Unless {disfmarker} do you guys wanna evaluate both ? I think between the two , somewhere between the two is true . {vocalsound} Yeah , I'd {disfmarker} It's more true than false , about a two . Okay . So we say true . {vocalsound} technologically innovative . {vocalsound} I d I don't think that's what we're aiming at with this concept . Yeah . I think we're using simple components that are gonna be robust but not particularly innovative . So we'll say {disfmarker} we'll say uh false . Easy to use . Very . Yes . {vocalsound} One , Mm-hmm . is that inappropriate ? Yeah . Okay . Oh , pardon me . Um Trendy . Oh yes . trendy , s {vocalsound} and I say specifically spongy fruity . Mm-hmm . Well , maybe only a two or a three then , 'cause it's no we still haven't decided about specific sponginess or specific {disfmarker} We have the worry about how robust it will be if it's it's curved as a banana but spongy . Hmm . I think {disfmarker} Yeah , I don't really think that's gonna work , yeah . but {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Okay , so two ? Um Yeah . Excess buttons . are there excess buttons ? No . No . No . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} That is false . So that's false . {vocalsound} Um {vocalsound} good , well designed buttons , intuitive buttons . Better , more intuitive buttons , yes . True . Ugly . No . No . {vocalsound} No . People don't respond well to ugly . Sellable , uh quirky , you know , something people {disfmarker} Yeah , I think they're different , aren't they ? Well it is quite it is quite quirky I think . like oh , I like it . yeah . Yeah , I do too . It could be quite a good brand , like a good little object . Oh yeah . And I was I was thinking of other things um in terms of uh could we say it's cost saving ? With the {disfmarker} Oh , we also need tho think about the energy . Is it the kinetic energy ? Yeah , with the energy . Mm . {vocalsound} If it's {disfmarker} it is gonna be environmentally friendly with the kinetic energy . Yeah . It is going to be kinetic ? Yeah . Mm-hmm . we'll c we'll say it's a cost saving enviro . Yeah , Uh so yes . Yeah , but we haven't completely developed that side of it yet , so we're not completely sure about that , Well {vocalsound} but yeah . you're still in the Play-Doh stage . Yeah . Anything else ? Including price , do you have any idea about price or other features ? Well I think our instinct is that it should be pretty cheap to develop . We haven't got a lot of expensive components in there . Yes , the instinct says true . Okay . So true one or should I go to two or three ? I'd put it at one I think , but {disfmarker} I dunno , what do you {disfmarker} I would say maybe a two , Okay . 'cause we still {disfmarker} we need to uh get somebody in who is good with the programming for the menus and things . Yeah , true , I mean it's not just like {disfmarker} I mean it's not like ev you know , on a normal chunky remote every button res I mean means something different , Yeah , that's not a cheap thing to get . it might be the {disfmarker} yeah , yeah , true . True . whereas this one has only got the four buttons and they all {disfmarker} they mean everything , depending on what menu you're in . Hmm . Yeah , that's a good point . {gap} uh we need somebody to develop that . Um other ? Anything else you guys can thing of ? And I'm gonna actually change a couple of these so then I'm gonna {disfmarker} instead of ugly I'm gonna say it's attractive and then make that true , so that {disfmarker} Yeah . 'cause I have to do an average . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Right . And then um excess buttons . Just putting no excess buttons . Exactly . Wow we're doing really well . Yeah , be you know , As for {disfmarker} so it doesn't ruin the polarity . see if we're technologically innovative , I'd say it is quite innovative , because there aren't really many that have this menu idea instead of all the extra buttons . Mm-hmm . I mean I know we're not doing anything involving internet or speech recognition but but we are at the upper end of the push button market . {vocalsound} Or L_C_D_ . Yeah . Well if you g uh let me know if if any of these {disfmarker} um if you if you all can think of any other um thing to change here {disfmarker} if you th if you think I should change the innovative or add other features . If not I'll average those . I think we're good . {vocalsound} Okay . Mm . Okay . We're a little over halfway through the meeting So {disfmarker} and the next big thing is the finance . Okay . Um okay , how about if I uh pass this back to you Yep . and I'll uh figure out the average here . Right . Thank you for everyone's help with that . Right . And as you can see it says the same thing , it had not lost itself , thank Goodness . And we're going to raise what's called a sp a spreadsheet that they provided to me . Um and it says fill in the number of components you plan to use in your device . {vocalsound} Hand dynamo , battery , kinetic , solar cells . Okay . Well , just kinetic then , {gap} . Yeah . {vocalsound} Yeah . Um what's a hand dynamo ? That was the crank , wind-up crank on the side . {vocalsound} It's the wind-up . Oh {vocalsound} shoot , forget that . Kinetic is um {disfmarker} and how many of those will we need per {disfmarker} we only need one . Just one . Okay . Electronic simple chip on print , and we'll need one of those . Uh uh yeah , I think we can do it all with simple {disfmarker} Just checking that . Yeah , simple , 'cause we've just got push buttons , so we can do it all with simple which is the ch should be the cheapest . Okay , and we only need one of those . Yep . Okay , the case will be uncurved and flat or a single curve or a double curve . It looks like it {gap} single curve , 'cause of th the chunkiness . It's {disfmarker} Yeah , that that one is single curve , that's uh uh one . isn't it ? Um do we have And that's What does double curved mean , I don't understand . I I think you {disfmarker} it means you reverse the curve . uh that's the the one that goes like this . Yeah . Yeah , I do I don't think we need that for either of them , Oh no , we don't need that . No . Right . you can do a banana in single curve , No , Single-curved , I'd say . single curve . yeah . Okay , case material supplements . Plastic , wood , rubber , titanium , special colour . I {vocalsound} I just wanna say plastic . We had the special colour . And did we say plastic ? Yeah , can we do some what ifs , 'cause it may {disfmarker} Yeah . I mean I I still quite like the idea of combining plastic and rubber myself , One , two , three , four , five , six . but it depends on the cost , I guess . Okay . We'll come back , if we can , to the rubber being added at the moment , that's where we are . Interface button {disfmarker} push button interface . That's what we're using , It's just button . Yes . Yeah . isn't it ? Yep . Yeah . Do we need to say how many buttons , or Whoops , don't want that , not yet . Um {disfmarker} or d is it just one ? No , it just says push button interface . Button supplements , they'll be in a special colour of black . 'Kay . And the buttons {disfmarker} Wha what is the buttons made of , rubber ? Uh they'll be rubber , yep . So we need one of them . And are they any special form ? Well yeah , like the compass point one . Actually , does tha does special material mean that plastic is not a special material ? 'Cause I think they can be plastic . 'Cause the rate we're going we can put the rubber on top . Yeah . They could be plastic , we don't have to have rubber buttons , Oh . because we haven't got a double curved case . Yeah , they could be plastic . {vocalsound} Okay . Um let's put that rubber in then , of the case material supplement . It's just one , isn't it ? Uh we only need one of them . Um and the total cost has been calculated as nine Pounds twenty out of the twelve and a half we were allowed . What , we're in . Yeah . We're in . {vocalsound} That's us . More profit . Great . Okay , I'm going to save this into our {vocalsound} desktop , project documents . Okay . As our project document bit . Do you do you need to double click on that to open it ? Yeah . There we are . That's the only Excel document that will be in there , so it's there for all of us . Okay , so , are they under twelve fifty ? Yes , go to the project evaluation , next slide . Yes . Right . Um the project process , satisfaction with , for example , the room for creativity . Yeah , leadership , teamwork , Yeah . Sure . Yes . means , of having whiteboard , the digital pens and all that kind of good things . {vocalsound} And Play-Doh . Uh-huh . Yeah , yeah , the Play-Doh was best , I thought . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah well , 'cause I mean it's so hard to describe what you mean just with words and pointing at photographs and saying , well we quite want this , but imagine it rounder . So much better just to go and , you know , this is it , this is what we want . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yep . Okay . {vocalsound} So , we went over all those things and we're satisfied with all the above . Yep . Um did we find any new ideas ? I think with the marketing element of uh fruit shaped I I mean I {disfmarker} that really opened my eyes . Yeah . {vocalsound} Spongy . I I only speak for myself though . And I'd never heard of the kinetic energy before , {vocalsound} Yeah . so . Good work as a design team , {vocalsound} Yeah , I think we're a good team actually . because we {disfmarker} I'm not sure all the wires are really great though . So we actually worked well as a group . I thought so . Right . Are the costs within the budget ? Yes . Oh yes . Yes . Is the project evaluated ? Yes . Yes . Yes . Yes . I can give you a number , hang on , Oh we haven't heard . {vocalsound} Uh-huh . um it's uh {disfmarker} the average evaluation score is one point eight eight , so it means w you know , I can I can spell it out . There were six true or ones , four um pardon me , two s almost true or close to true , so that was four points , and then uh one false , seven points , so seventeen divided by nine {disfmarker} we're between one and two . I would say that's ex excellent in terms of uh ho how much we adhere to the ideals of the uh market place . Yeah . And the the only false one is because we've chosen to keep a simple old technology , To maintain old technology , exactly . Mm-hmm . which if it works perfectly well I see no point in improving on if it works , Yeah , yeah . {vocalsound} Absolutely , and it's kept us within budget . so . Yeah . Yes . Mm-hmm . So we do count as I think excellent or one . Alright . {gap} . And we've therefore {disfmarker} we have to do the final questionnaire and do the meeting summary , I have a final report to present , um and then we're done . Okay . We done good , and we're finished in time . Bring on the ice sculptures . Nice . And then we get the product launch party . So we might have to wait . Product launch party ? Yeah . {vocalsound} That's what I said , ice sculptures . Yeah . {vocalsound} Absolutely . {vocalsound} Um I {disfmarker} one thing I want to do is {disfmarker} oh , I think the meeting's done . I believe that is the end of our meeting . Thank you , Melissa . {vocalsound} Yeah . Um one thing I wa I wanna do is save everything in the right files , because I don't think everything is saved . The right files . Final meeting market",
        "summarize": "After Project Manager first went over the previous meeting and summarized the meeting agenda, Inudstrial Designer started the prototype presentation of the remote control.  The remote control should be curved with scroll and push buttons, made by smooth plastic or spongy rubber. Marketing presented the evaluation criteria of the remote control in terms of the user requirements and the trends. The remote control shall be fancy because it was heavily reliant on appearance instead of pure functionality. Finally, they confirmed the components they planned to use under the restrict of finance."

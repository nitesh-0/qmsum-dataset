        "transcript": "It's Play-Doh . Play-Doh's edible . Did you know that ? It's definitely {disfmarker} Because kids {disfmarker} yeah . I used to eat it . I've , I've definitely eaten it before . I didn't know was edible . {vocalsound} {gap} . Yeah . It's it's chew proof . {vocalsound} But um , it's it's made edible 'cause , yeah . It's made edible 'cause kids eat it , Yeah . and if it's wasn't edible then {disfmarker} Well , normal babies . {vocalsound} Actually that makes sense , because I remember like , peopl I dunno if my Mom ever did it but I remember other people's Moms making like home-made Play-Doh where you just like make the {gap} colouring and make some sort of sort of dough . Yeah . Oh yeah it is , yeah . Oh yeah . {vocalsound} Right . Mm-hmm . Everybody everybody ready ? Yep . Yeah . Okay , let's have your um {disfmarker} let's get {gap} have the uh presentation ? {vocalsound} We've got some {gap} . We've got a cool prototype . Yeah , it's pretty exciting . So , everything uh that we wanted we wanted it to be ergonomic and to be made out of rubber , very simple and easy to use , Double curved . Nice . yeah , double curved , {vocalsound} um but also something that was gonna jump out at people , something that would be different uh , separate it from the other remotes out on the market . So uh I think if you put this in the palm of your hand , you'll see what a nice thing we have going here . {vocalsound} That is cool . So , basically , if you hold it like that , the one on your thumb , yeah , {vocalsound} the thumb button is the power button . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Your index finger is channel up , middle finger is channel down , ring finger is volume up , your pinkie is volume down . What's the big blue thing ? That's the lock button , has a L_ L_ on it Oh cool . and then the M_ is a mute button . And then it also has digit {gap} what button ? Um . Oh mute . For muting the uh {disfmarker} And mute . Um and then then you can also {disfmarker} there's a numeric keypad on the top so you can key directly to the to the channel if you want . {vocalsound} Okay . So it's really basic functionalities as far as what keys are available , but we think it's very comfortable and very innovative and it looks different . That certainly does . {vocalsound} So all the , I mean the important keys are right at your f f you know right at uh at a convenient place for you to to access them . Mm . Which is ant anti-R_S_I_ . So you don't you {disfmarker} Yeah . It should be . Mm . And it's also conformable to the size of your hand . I mean if that's too big , it's a rubber remote , so you can , you know Yeah . 'S great . change that . So d does that uh what {disfmarker} mesh with what you guys were hoping and for and expecting or does it {disfmarker} Oh it's so cute . {vocalsound} I have one thing about it , but it's a small thing , but it'd mean we'd have to make a right-handed one and a left-handed one . Oh right , yeah . Ah , that's good thinking , yeah . But , that's I don't see why that's not possible . Yeah , if we build rocket ships why can't we build left-handed and right-handed uh remotes . Yeah . {gap} They make left-handed scissors , you know . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah , I didn't I didn't think about that , but I'd {disfmarker} yeah , {gap} . Yeah , but then but then you can learn to use your right h like I was just thinking if there's left-handers and right-handers in the family , what , they have two remotes ? Yes s Yeah , I know I know people who have left-handed and right-handed people in the family and they all use the computer {vocalsound} for the whole {disfmarker} the same computer the fes family and they have a mouse , and everybody is using right-handed mouse . Mm . Sure . Sure . Yeah , I'm sure they'll be able to {disfmarker} Uh-huh . I mean it's only pressing buttons , you don't have to do anything , you know , extraordinary . I think everybody can press a button with their left and right hand so {disfmarker} Yeah . Imagine d are you right handed ? Yeah . Imagine you're doing it with your left hand , I don't think it's too {disfmarker} Yeah , it's not {disfmarker} But we can have both uh {disfmarker} Yeah . Have them in stock . Yeah . Yeah . Make 'em more appealing as well . But um other than that , I mean uh and that's um , you know , that's just something , I think I think it's great , yeah , great idea . Do you think it says {vocalsound} R_R_ ? {gap} I think it does . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} I think it's , well , if the R_R_ motto is , we bring fashion to to electronics , I'd say that could be quite fashionable . Fashion to electronics . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . And it's got the b the black and yellow and blue . {vocalsound} Yeah . Plus red , which is sort of a a fruit and vegetable uh uh . {vocalsound} Yeah . {gap} . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} There you go . So that's that's {vocalsound} our end of things wha uh {disfmarker} Yeah , very good , yeah . That's {disfmarker} It's come up with what we've you know , the things that's what we've {disfmarker} what we were looking at doing , hasn't it , {gap} all seems to be there . Yeah . Well done . And all the playing around is uh {disfmarker} Um before we move on {disfmarker} Yeah , I'm just {disfmarker} do you wanna plug in ? I need that cable . Okay . Thank you . Yeah . Um . One thing I do need to do {disfmarker} we need to look at , is the costs . The costs , was that what you said ? Play-Doh is very cheap . {vocalsound} Well , yeah . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Mm . {gap} um {disfmarker} Play-Doh won't last very long everybody'll go like , oops , it's gone . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} But it's edible . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Chew proof . {vocalsound} Well , they'll buy more of them if you eat them , {gap} . That was the main criteria from the last meeting , it had to be chew proof . {vocalsound} Yeah . Uh right . {vocalsound} Okay , now I think we'll do this {disfmarker} I could do {disfmarker} you know , I can do this o on my own or I could do it with you , Yeah . Oh ho-ho . but it's just easy enough to go through it with you , so we're going for the kinetic power . Yep . {vocalsound} And the electronics , we decided on it being just a simple , the easiest thing that's inside it . Ooh . {vocalsound} So {disfmarker} the case , we've gone for the double curved . Um and it's made out of rubber . {vocalsound} The interface is push-buttons . And button supplements well they're in diff special colours , aren't they ? Yeah . So {gap} special colours . Yeah . It's better for {disfmarker} Special form , yeah , they're a special form there in shapes and stuff . Yeah , I mean , {vocalsound} these these ones on the side are curved kind of , so {disfmarker} And special material . Yep . Yeah . Um . Are they made out of any special material ? Rubber . No they're not . They're not made out of wood or titanium or rubber or anything , they're just simple {disfmarker} The buttons are rubber . Well they're rubber , aren't they ? Okay . Right . Yeah . So let's see if that comes within budget . And it does . That is gonna cost uh {disfmarker} {gap} . We're under budget . Yeah . That's gonna cost ten ten Euro seventy cents a unit to make . And our target was it had to come in at under twelve fifty . That's cool . Yeah . Yeah . So , And we're actua actually making a better profit than we expected . this is all very very good . The bosses will be very pleased . {vocalsound} Okay , let's just save this so I can e-mail it to you . Uh . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Save it in {gap} save it in the uh {vocalsound} my documents . It's already saved , I think . Splendid . Okay . So uh , that's {gap} done with this with this um doodah , so you're {gap} . Gonna do {disfmarker} what you were gonna do , Thank you . Mm . your evaluation . Oh , yeah . This is where we all get to {vocalsound} I get to write on the , oops , on the board . Right . {vocalsound} Oh . 'S function {disfmarker} F_ eight . Okay . {gap} I love the smell of that Play-Doh . {vocalsound} Yeah , {vocalsound} I cou {gap} . {vocalsound} Mm . have some have some . Okay . So , {vocalsound} evaluation . We're gonna do it all together so we evaluate each criteria . I've got the criterias . And we have to do it on a scale of one to seven , one being true , so it's it's more like it's {disfmarker} fits the criteria , and seven being as in it doesn't fit the criteria . And the criterias are , and I'll draw this up on the board {disfmarker} {vocalsound} so we have a box {disfmarker} {gap} . And this is false , this is just like to keep you informed . So seven's here and one's here and then you've got in the middle . {vocalsound} So the first criteria . Do you all get what we're doing ? Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Okay , cool . Okay , first criteria , look and feel . So the does remote look and feel fashionable to what we talked about ? As it {disfmarker} is it colour-wise and is it spongy ? Mm . So what mark should we give for that ? I would give it a seven . Yeah . As in it's not . Oh sorry , one , d yeah . Oh , sorry , one . {vocalsound} A one . A one a one . So I'll just write criteria criteria one we get one . Second criteria , new technology . Have we implemented new technology ? As in the new high-tech {vocalsound} {disfmarker} Well , the kinetic thing , yeah . Yeah . Yeah . That was our main technological innovation w every everything else was fairly simple , but the fact that we used the kinetic energy was new . {gap} . So it's {gap} . So we'll give it a {disfmarker} Well so the um {disfmarker} It's ergonomic , {vocalsound} but that's not {disfmarker} that's that's a design that's a des that's a design thing , yeah . Yeah , but that's not a technological thing , that's another thing , i that's another marketing thing . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . True . So on the technical side of it it {disfmarker} Yeah . I'd say it's about a a twoish ? Two . It's about in the mid in the middle somewhere , Two . maybe , yeah , I dunno . Three . Yeah . Maybe three , yeah . {gap} three . So criteria three is is it easy to use ? Easy to use . I think it's a one , I think . I'd say it's I wouldn't {disfmarker} Yeah . not if you're left-handed it's not . I would give it a I would give it a two , Mm . Two , 'cause i i it i it i it is more geared for right-handed people than left-handed people , but {disfmarker} so it's {disfmarker} Okay . Mm . But if we make a right-handed and a left-handed then ? If we're gonna have one left-handed and one right-handed then I would give it a one , but otherwise otherwise a two . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Give it a t give it a two . Yeah , okay . {vocalsound} 'Kay , criteria four is costs . {gap} Cost . It's come in under budget . {vocalsound} 's great . So that's a definite one . Yeah . That was great . Yeah . Amount of buttons . Like the amount of buttons , Contains only the necessary buttons . 'cause people like a lot le like {disfmarker} So it's a one ? Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Um criteria six . R_S_I_ is it good against ? {vocalsound} Yes s yeah . Yes . Very good . So it's anti-R_S_I_ . It's one . And criteria seven , which is the last one , does it get lost ? It's yellow . Is it easy to get lost ? I don't think it's gonna get lost easily . {vocalsound} It is very bright , yeah . {vocalsound} No ? But it is smallish . Two . It's not the kinda thing that's gonna slip like between a couch cushion or something , you know . Maybe it will . Uh . T Mm . I think i it would , could be , could get lost . You think it could lost {disfmarker} {gap} two . Mm . Yeah . Mm . I mean it {disfmarker} I mean it's not fully it's not fully {disfmarker} like you can't say {disfmarker} No , I mean I mean , it's not a one , definitely . I mean , you could still flush it down the toilet theoretically , but {disfmarker} Okay . Yeah , anything , I mean . Okay . It's bigger than the average mobile , I guess . Yeah . But , yeah , it can get lost . The mobiles get lost all the time . Yeah . Okay , yeah , two is fine . But then you ring 'em and you find them . {vocalsound} So {disfmarker} Mm . Mm . Yeah , yeah . Okay . Yeah . So , that's that . So that's the evaluation , so I'd say {disfmarker} Yay . Alright it's all all systems go . {vocalsound} We've , we've done well . It's like {vocalsound} {gap} like a number one . Um . Yeah . Number one product . Mm . {vocalsound} We can't fail . All done , thanks . We fitted all the criterias . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah . {gap} . Yeah , so {disfmarker} Well done , Reissa . So that's that one . Okay , I I think um I just wanna put in as Project Manager the you know , little bit of praise for everybody here for how they've worked on it , {vocalsound} you know , both individually and as a team . You know you've w everyone's come up with their own individual ideas in their own different departments , um and then come together and worked in , you know , integrally , you know , at the right times , psp , you know , especially you two . {vocalsound} That's all , you know , gone very very well Yeah . and and and be you know , has been good communication going on . {vocalsound} Yeah , during our design I mean there was some s some heated heated discussion , {vocalsound} but we we kept {disfmarker} we tried to keep it cool and and {vocalsound} Did you have to go down to the the corporate squash court and bash a few balls about ? {vocalsound} {vocalsound} just just {disfmarker} Well . {vocalsound} We just had to we just had to squeeze our product a little bit and {disfmarker} {vocalsound} You know {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Fantastic . It is {gap} . Now you guys have been a a great team . Think we're the we're the envy of all the of all the other R_R_ teams , {gap} . {gap} been cool . I think {disfmarker} So {vocalsound} I I , you know , and I think we've co we have come we've come up with something new , something that hasn't been done before , we haven't {disfmarker} we're not just rehashing an old design . In four diff in in four meetings . Yeah . Funny , all designer meetings could be this quick . You know , maybe this isn't a simulation , maybe this is actually {disfmarker} so it's like Sony or someone like that they're they're just , yeah , {gap} they get {gap} {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Yeah I think they're actually trying to find ideas for a ideal remote . {vocalsound} They're using our ideas . {vocalsound} Yeah . Yeah , {gap} two years' time this will be on the market . {vocalsound} Ex exactly that product {vocalsound} {vocalsound} um thum {disfmarker} we'll go , yeah , we designed that and no-one will believe us . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} But um {disfmarker} So at this stage , I mean , is this the last meeting of the project ? We don't uh have another one after it's gone gone to marke market or something ? Yeah . No , {gap} I think when this meeting's finished like officially , there b we'll get a uh questionnaire to fill in . {vocalsound} Y Oh really ? {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Or six , uh {disfmarker} Just start summarising now . {vocalsound} You can reply to the same message . I haven't got message . See summary , there . If you just reply to that one . So there's no way to like predict what our {disfmarker} 'Cause we had a {disfmarker} we originally had a {vocalsound} {disfmarker} As far as our financial uh um goals , we had a specific number for profits that we wanted . It was fifty mil fifty million {disfmarker} Was it was it fifty or five ? I don't remember . But there's not a way to compute that , I mean , since we saved on the on the production cost , do we know how much we're making on profit ? It gets handed over to another department . Depends how much we sell . Uh . What our what our project was was to come up with the product , basically . Hmm . {gap} the for the {disfmarker} and just basically is it it come {disfmarker} can {disfmarker} is it within budget . When it c when it comes to all the other things of how to sell it and , you know , the b the profits and all that that's other departments {disfmarker} it's another team that actually work out the mai the {disfmarker} But we have a vested interest {gap} oh yeah , the {disfmarker} all the guys in the profit sharing , yeah . prof profit sharing {vocalsound} . {vocalsound} Um . Yeah , that's it . You know , we've we've we've made i we've made We finished an hour earlier . {vocalsound} we've designed the product , we've ma we've got the prototype , it's within budget , it's {disfmarker} does everything that we wanted it to do . It's new , it's it's um something that uh {vocalsound} that isn't out there already . I think actually {disfmarker} and one advantage of of this is that after the uh , you know , after this fad of fruit and vegetables passes this will still be c a cool remote , you know . Mm . We're not we're not you know , tying tying our cart to that one horse {gap} . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah . Mm . Well , this is very marketable in that it is it's it's something that's kind of new and looks a bit quirky for people who want that , Definitely . it's {disfmarker} that it's um , hang on , I wrote it down here somewhere {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Oh no I thi I put it in one of my e-mails that I sent off . Um that , you know , it's marketable in the sense that it's {disfmarker} whilst all these other remotes uh actually do give you repetitive strain injury , our one does the complete opposite , you know , Mm . Mm . so that's something that's new , which is one of the criteria they asked us to come up with something with something new . Mm . It make watching T_V_ healthy . Yeah , and if you're not having a good time with the T_V_ , you can f throw it about , you know . Yeah . {vocalsound} It's fine , it's kid proof . Just don't sh don't throw it at any of the ornaments and break them . Uh . Well , you can break the ornaments , but you won't break that . No {gap} . {vocalsound} Yeah . So all in all , I think we've done very well . Mm yep . Well done everybody . Right , you too . Yay . Um . Drinks are on the company . {vocalsound} Cool . {vocalsound} In the corporate bar that's next to the corporate swimming pool on the top floor that we're that've all just gained access to . {vocalsound} Mm . {vocalsound} Glad to hear that . {vocalsound} Yeah . That's it . That's it . Well , as far as I t as far as I know . Um . Yep . We haven't got the five minute left thing yet . No . Anyone wanna play I spy ? {vocalsound} Mm mm . {vocalsound} I guess it's probably better that we wrap it up than have five minutes of silence . Should we call the day then ? Yeah , I guess . I mean we're gonna get asked to fill out another questionnaire . Uh , right . Um . It's probably gonna be the same as one we've done before . Mm-hmm . But I'm not the authority to say that it is . In {gap} project . Um how does everyone feel about the technology that's been used in this ? The sort of using of the the pens and writing on these special pads and all that ? I love it . {vocalsound} I love it . {vocalsound} I think it's cool . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Being all wired up and a vibrating pen and {disfmarker} it's cool . {vocalsound} Being watched . Um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Your moment to shine . {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} Wow . I thi you know , I'd I'd n yeah , as we said earlier , I've not {disfmarker} never seen that before . {gap} something that t the whiteboard Yeah . thingy , {vocalsound} that's great . Um , but a p a pen with a camera on it , I don't think it's such a new thing . I mean it's i or in such a new idea . It would be different if it was sort of hand writing recognition stuff , but as it's not {disfmarker} Yeah . it's literally that'll come up on a computer screen as a picture file rather than actual text . Mm . Right , I think they do want to do hand writing recognition on that , it's just the first step . Yeah . Yeah . Mm . {vocalsound} Logitech . I guess we should end this , since we're off off topic . So . Shall we {disfmarker} Yeah . Meeting adjourned . Right . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah .",
        "summarize": "The meeting began with a presentation on the prototype by Industrial Designer and User Interface and a double curved rubber prototype with anti-RSI buttons was displayed. Next, they discussed the cost of the remote which only cost ten seventy euros a unit and well under the budget of twelve fifty. Then, the team evaluated the remote according to seven criteria and it passed with flying colours as three criteria scored a one and others no more than three. Finally, the meeting ended with team building and a wrap-up, which Project Marketing concluded that the novel remote fit all criteria and the team did a great job."

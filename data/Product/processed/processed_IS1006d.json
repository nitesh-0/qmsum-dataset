        "transcript": "Mm . So , So , uh now {vocalsound} Hi Christa . {vocalsound} it's the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Hi Sammy . {vocalsound} It's the detail design meeting , so we're going {disfmarker} last meeting . So um , first uh Mark and Rama are going to present uh the prototype . Uh then uh Sammy will propose some uh crite cr criteria to evaluate this prototype . Then , w we {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yes . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yes . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} And then we going to do some finance to see if uh it is uh feasible And chocolate ? {vocalsound} {vocalsound} and uh at the end we will we will um evaluate ourself as a team . {vocalsound} And that's all . Okay . So first , {vocalsound} let's uh see the prototype . Mm . Yeah . {vocalsound} Uh , here we have our prototype model . Okay . And you have some slides then ? Mm-hmm . Yeah . Yeah , we have also some slides . {gap} Yeah . Mm . Yes , and place some slides . Okay . Uh so in which uh {disfmarker} Uh , participant three . {vocalsound} Prototype . In {disfmarker} Yeah . Mm okay . Mm . Five . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Uh , so this is our remote control . Him . {vocalsound} It's a r working prototype . You can use it now by switching all these buttons . So first , I present as we came to this perfect model , {vocalsound} and then we'll give some technical specifications . Yeah . Mm-hmm . That's {vocalsound} well {vocalsound} {vocalsound} , so that's that . Please , next slide . We analysed all the fruits {vocalsound} and contacted NASA , and uh made some {vocalsound} real good {disfmarker} MASA ? {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah . If you can see this , and the stars are showing that {gap} . And um , {vocalsound} s society will accept that . For sure . Mm-hmm . {vocalsound} And making some analysis of different fruits , we choose the ultimate form , ultimate colours , and uh ultimate smell of it . S please , next slide . But we still didn't want to go far from our titanium idea , 'cause it's the most of the moder the m the {gap} modern material we can p select . And it's practical . And it's still say it's for our needs , so please press something . And as I said , {vocalsound} it's perfect . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Okay . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Please press it . Experience . Explanat Everyone is {gap} f really uh really glad to obtain an {disfmarker} {vocalsound} s such a r such a device . Such a nice thing . {vocalsound} See this {gap} . {vocalsound} So you can touch it with your hands . Can I ? Sure . Yes . {vocalsound} You can {disfmarker} Ho-ho . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} imitating flatulence] {vocalsound} What do you say ? {vocalsound} N It says {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} You must say it . {vocalsound} Spongy . I will uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} One day . I'll buy it . {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} If I if I need so . {vocalsound} He {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Hopefully my daughter will like it . {vocalsound} Okay . Y and we got the answer . Uh , it is , yes , of course . Yes , of course . Of c course . {vocalsound} {gap} , please next slide . Um , this is a prototype . You can have a look at it , and {disfmarker} That's all I wanted to say . Ah . Now it's technical specification by our colleague . Hmm . Hmm . So {disfmarker} Oh , there is {vocalsound} a button missing . {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} Okay . {vocalsound} This this is really flexible . You can add your buttons . It's in option . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah . So function , mm {disfmarker} Mm-hmm . {vocalsound} So , as we discussed , we have to switch on switch off whenever we want . And so , we have buttons and using L_C_D_ , or like you can use this {vocalsound} jog wheel and select which ever option on the L_C_D_ , and then do on and off . {vocalsound} Then you ha you'll have volume control . So , you you can press these buttons to increase or decrease the volume . {vocalsound} And we have some L_C_D_ controls . Like , m switching the L_C_D_ display if you want to use L_C_D_ , or you don't want you can just use normal button . Mm-hmm . And we have speech recognition . Here you have microphone , and then it date records your voice , and then it try to recognise . Hmm . {vocalsound} And it can also do the action . {vocalsound} And location finder . And we want to do the location basically using speech recogniser . You can just say , where is my remote control . Mm-hmm . Or uh , you can just give some nickname to your remote control , like Bobby {gap} . {vocalsound} Bobby . {vocalsound} Mm-hmm . {vocalsound} Hey , babe . {vocalsound} And then , {vocalsound} it will say hi . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Bob . {vocalsound} Hey Bob . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah , hi , and then you can use it . {vocalsound} Okay , Hmm . {vocalsound} 'Kay . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} that's good . So , {vocalsound} um our team is now fruits . Mainly strawberry . So , you can {vocalsound} have {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Oh , these are strawberries . {vocalsound} And then you can see the look L_C_D_ and all the switches . {vocalsound} Are colourful . Yeah . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Material , we want to stick to titanium . {vocalsound} We will send , we want to {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Fruit smelling spongy titanium . {vocalsound} I didn't know it exist , but that's great . Yeah , or s {vocalsound} So , we want to have {vocalsound} simple and perfect shapes , like I shown in these phones . You can have your own designs and and you can feel simple designs . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} And you can choose colours on your day for each day , or even many colours . Ha . Ho-ho . That's for the L_C_D_ or for the titanium ? You mean we can change the colour uh of th For the L_C_D_ . Yeah . Yeah okay , for the L_C_D_ . With titanium it's {disfmarker} it is silver . Tit titanium is {disfmarker} We are still working on titanium . Mm-mm . Yeah . So , r we'll start with L_C_D_ . Uh , okay . {vocalsound} Mm , yeah . {vocalsound} You can ask Bob . It's Tuesday . {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} Hey , you know you're theme today . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah , Bob , please . {vocalsound} {gap} Tuesday colour . {vocalsound} Yeah . Even you can configure your colours for its {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} depending on your mood , or s Okay . Hmm . Mm-hmm . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Black for Sunday . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} And you can have many colours on weekends . Or {disfmarker} {vocalsound} And w wait , wh what are the strawberries for ? {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Wh wh Huh ? On the L_C_D_ ? Ah , these are like sensors . Oh . Mm-hmm . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Of course . That's location sensors . {vocalsound} What do you think ? {vocalsound} Strawberry sensors . {vocalsound} Very useful . Okay . {vocalsound} Strawberries . So , {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} after this meeting we'll propose a party for our success for {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Ah . {vocalsound} Lounge meeting . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} So , if you are vegetarian or you have any options , please let us know . {vocalsound} Yeah , and we can just {gap} some strawberry first . Um {disfmarker} Yeah . {vocalsound} Okay . {vocalsound} Mm-hmm . {vocalsound} Alright . Good . {vocalsound} Oops . S So , huh . Interesting . In interesting . Mm mm . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} So , any specific questions for {disfmarker} we'll see in the financial part if uh {vocalsound} all {vocalsound} {gap} {vocalsound} gets into {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} It makes sense . Yeah . {vocalsound} Let's make a party first maybe . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} W Who is the five uh {disfmarker} fifty millions we {vocalsound} first make a party in ? Yeah . Then we can discuss {disfmarker} We can {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah , then we can have how much for how money is left . {vocalsound} So uh , this is {disfmarker} Mm-hmm . What a design . Okay . {vocalsound} Uh , so {disfmarker} Let's uh , {vocalsound} It's my turn . yeah , let's see if uh th it's meet the evaluation criterium . {vocalsound} Mm-hmm . Let's see if this {disfmarker} Yeah , if you meet {vocalsound} the evaluation criterion . {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} Oops . {vocalsound} Fudge . Yeah . So , evaluation please . So . You made a very nice prototype , and um , I think , we now need altogether to try to evaluate it to see if it makes sense to do it , if it fulfils our {disfmarker} what we want to do , and things like that . So mm {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Uh , next slide , please . {vocalsound} As you know , before going and uh creating and producing these strawberry {vocalsound} uh {vocalsound} remote control , it's very important to first verify if it makes sense , if we have a chance to sell it . {vocalsound} Yeah . Uh , so we need to evaluate it um , try to do it in a constative way , and as much as we can . To {disfmarker} so what I propose is that we are going to to have this scale from one to seven . One meaning that , ye yes uh it fulfils uh the the criterion , whatever it is . And seven meaning , no it doesn't fulfil at all . And we're all l going to list all the criterion . I'm going to go to that next slide , Okay . and together try to evaluate this according to this criterion and from one to seven . And then we are just going to have an average , which will give us the value of our uh remote control . So , maybe we can have a look at the criteria ? Fancy . So these are the criterion uh I'm {disfmarker} I thought were important . Of course , this can be discussed , but let's let's see , so let's vote . So we have fancy here and we have the scale from one to seven with four in the middle . Mm-hmm . Huh . So , Yeah , what's is really {disfmarker} what do you think , is it fancy ? {vocalsound} Uh , it's really {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Uh , I think that fancy , we can say it is fancy . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} It is very very fancy . Or have you ever seen something like that ? {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Oh . I am not the d the only one choosing , yeah . Yeah , of course . Uh what do you think ? What do you think ? Feel the weight . Is it {disfmarker} The weight is later . Yeah . Oh . Really . {vocalsound} Uh-huh . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Now {vocalsound} we're {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Okay . We're on the fanciness now . I think it's quite fancy . Yeah , yeah . Yeah . Yeah . We can give at least five or six , seven . It's uh {disfmarker} Yeah , so {disfmarker} No it's it's one . It's in the other {gap} . Oh , {gap} Oh . So {disfmarker} Oh , okay . Yeah , okay . Oh , okay . So {disfmarker} Yeah , o one means it's , yes , a very fancy and seven mean no at all . Mm . {vocalsound} So it's one or two . Two . Let's say two , yeah . M maybe two . What do you think ? Two ? Two . Two . Okay . So here , two . Up . Technology . Then we have uh technology . Yeah . Um {disfmarker} So , what about technology ? We have uh we have speech recognition , we have location based {gap} , And we have L_C_D_ . we have L_C_D_ . Change colour of t So you change colours . Change colour , I mean that's very {disfmarker} Useful . Yeah , I think it's a {disfmarker} Quite Yeah , yeah , yeah . d I think it's a one for that , at least . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Uh {disfmarker} Yeah , yeah . It's silly . At least a one , yeah . Mm-mm . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Robustness , uh-huh . Uh , still we need to cha {vocalsound} {vocalsound} So {vocalsound} let's suppose my daughter take it and um {vocalsound} {disfmarker} and through it away . {vocalsound} Um {disfmarker} Do you think it makes sense that it's going to live again ? Uh , maybe not the prototype . The strawberries {vocalsound} Yeah , it {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Oh . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Let's try . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Oh my god . {vocalsound} Maybe strawberry . Okay , we just lost one strawberry . No . Oh . So {disfmarker} {vocalsound} No . How can I say this . Not at all ? Yeah , we can easily plug it . It's still it's still working , and your daughter got a bonus . It is {disfmarker} Yeah . {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} A strawberry . So it's not so bad . Mm-mm . Yeah , yeah . I um uh I would say three . Yeah . But it's too {gap} . Yeah . It's um robust , yeah . Yeah , that does make sense , yeah ? Useful ? Useful . {vocalsound} Well , so the question is does it have uh the minimum requirement of re remote control ? Yeah , {gap} {disfmarker} So I don't know . These buttons are uh {disfmarker} It not clear . Oh , yeah , lets me try . But you have at least uh next produce . Yeah . Yeah . What is uh next , please ? Yeah , channel . I this is volume control and channel changes . These are the main {disfmarker} Uh , it depends on the {disfmarker} And you can uh do di two sites ? Okay . You {disfmarker} Yeah . Yeah . Yeah , and you can do on L_C_D_ using these going to scrolling all the option . Okay , also . So if you don't want {disfmarker} So but , for instance , because the L_C_D_ is not uh touch control , touch screen , you cannot go to channel twenty five directly . Yeah , um {disfmarker} yeah . You can , by using the {disfmarker} You can . Yeah . Directly . You go {disfmarker} you {disfmarker} You c push here the the {disfmarker} So , the basic mode {disfmarker} yeah . {vocalsound} Yeah . So that's simple . The basic mode is uh you got just two buttons and a jog dial . Yeah . With two buttons , you do this like uh volume up , volume down . Oh , it's a jog dial , okay . Or if you go to the site , it's channel up channel down . And channel . Uh-huh . Okay . And if you want to make to s twenty-five , you push on this . Yeah . You select twenty , you select five . You can select . {vocalsound} Okay . That's it . Yeah mm . It's much longer than that that being two two five , no ? No . Don't you think so ? May {disfmarker} not {disfmarker} okay , we can go . That's uh {disfmarker} You're right . Yeah , yeah , yeah . Y you need to like press two and five and {disfmarker} Yeah . That's {disfmarker} it's less uh {disfmarker} Yeah . But it's it's nice , because people anyway don't go there . Yeah , yeah . Yeah mm . But {disfmarker} {vocalsound} So what do you think for it , usefulness ? So , d Yeah , we need to address {disfmarker} we want {disfmarker} Seems to be useful . {vocalsound} we only address two main functions here and the other functions will be on L_C_D_ . So {vocalsound} Let me understand well , so {disfmarker} because I'm not sure {disfmarker} that's for {disfmarker} that this one are b d uh two dir directional button . Both . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Up . Up down or left right . Yeah . Yeah . And which {disfmarker} what is that ? It's a jog dial for controlling the cursor on the L_C_D_ screen . This is jog wheel . That {disfmarker} Okay , okay . It's a kind {disfmarker} Oh , okay okay . {vocalsound} Like , selecting the menus . Yeah . Um , {vocalsound} see in L_C_D_ , like you will have blocks and you select which one . Cool . Oh oh okay , great . I would say then uh {disfmarker} {gap} Now it's looks us useful . Yeah . Yeah . Two or three ? Yeah . Two or three ? Two , maybe . {vocalsound} Two . {vocalsound} Yeah . Okay , two . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} So size and weight . Yeah , yeah . {gap} Is it the the the effective size and weight that the {disfmarker} Is it uh real size , real weight ? Or {disfmarker} Because it {disfmarker} Yeah , it's {disfmarker} size al almost {gap} {disfmarker} Size is going to be that , yeah ? Yeah , because it is {disfmarker} Uh , and and {disfmarker} The weight will be bit lighter . We will s We use titanium . Sure , Mm-mm . without titanium alloy , it's going to be light . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . It's going to be lighter , {vocalsound} Of course . because this seems to be very heavy f I mean , Heavy . Yeah . for my daughter , for instance . Mm-hmm . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} Not sure if uh {vocalsound} she can use it . {vocalsound} But sides {disfmarker} uh , the sides should be okay . {gap} . Yeah So , should be okay . mm . Up to three for that , Mm-mm . because I'm {disfmarker} haven't seen the weight so I must not uh {disfmarker} Okay . Okay . {vocalsound} Oh . Colour and shape . {vocalsound} Uh-oh . {vocalsound} Well , so colour , it seems that we have the several colours for the L_C_D_ . Yeah . Yeah . But um , it's not very clear what is the colour of the sh the sh {vocalsound} the case . {vocalsound} Yeah . The case is silver titanium , no ? It's a {disfmarker} it's going to be titanium . Okay , okay . Yeah , it's {gap} . Yeah . That's nice . Let's imagine . {vocalsound} I think it's good . Okay . {vocalsound} And what about the strawberries on the top ? {vocalsound} I'm not convince . {vocalsound} But maybe I'm not trendy . But , uh {disfmarker} Yahoo . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Well y you know , it's this uh fruit and vegetable year . Oh . Yeah , yeah . Yeah . Yeah , but uh {vocalsound} uh they're not useful . So {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I I mean it {disfmarker} that's uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} So maybe , I think {disfmarker} Uh , I think usefulness is m as as I rem um just have to remind you that usefulness is much less important than fanciness . Mm-hmm . Yeah . Yep . Yeah , well {disfmarker} Whether it's fancy or not now , it {disfmarker} we have to decide . Hmm . Yeah . Um {disfmarker} But this I would have m uh i found more fancy that the fruits are useful . If it's {disfmarker} Uh-huh . So , that they will {disfmarker} that maybe the fruit may be here instead . {vocalsound} Yeah . Yeah , well then it's bit difficult to use . Not like this d We're just giving the fruit for more fanciness and more attraction , too . Mm-hmm . But the n {vocalsound} Yeah . So , maybe think we can have rubber or some sponges , stuff for strawberries and different colours . Mm . So it's {disfmarker} So , it seems we are not so clear on the shape uh {disfmarker} Even {disfmarker} No , I'm not sure uh why {disfmarker} These buttons {disfmarker} uh if it was like this {disfmarker} {gap} But it looks really {vocalsound} not really good . I It's {gap} n {vocalsound} no , it's not fancy any more . I mean , the f Yeah . So these are kind of rubber things . Even if you lose one you can just put whatever . Okay . And {disfmarker} Even we can provide many different colours or different fruits , and {disfmarker} Uh-huh . And different routes . Okay , I see what {disfmarker} Moreover , moreover it covers it covers all the end goals . Even if it is , you know , it's very rounded , Yeah . but still you got some rubber fruit here , and it's completely uh completely secure to leave it uh with children and that . Yeah . Okay , so you you you feel like it's something uh a protection for the remote control . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah , we've {disfmarker} yeah we have sensors here and so here and here , Also . so we just {disfmarker} Yeah , so even if you don't put , it works . But this is really fancy . {gap} Okay . I suggested three . Okay . {vocalsound} Because uh , everybody s doesn't seem to be convince , Okay . Okay . although it's quite {disfmarker} Yeah . You have good arguments . Yeah . But {disfmarker} Okay . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} And uh the last one is adaptive . This is not r maybe not as important as the other one , {vocalsound} Yeah . but uh can we adapt it to each each personal use ? Sure , sure , just look at it . {vocalsound} It's full adaptable . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Great . {vocalsound} Wow , that's a {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Fully adaptable . Yeah , you can fit it into your palm , you know . That's {disfmarker} Yeah . {vocalsound} So you can fit into your palm , okay . Yea Yeah . {vocalsound} That {disfmarker} You can {disfmarker} What else can we need ? Yeah . {vocalsound} You {disfmarker} Do you think you are gonna be able to do that with ti titanium as well ? Yeah , it's fudge titanium . {vocalsound} You know . {vocalsound} It's fudge , yeah , yeah . Right , yeah . {vocalsound} And uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Mm , {gap} {disfmarker} Yeah , fruit titanium , yeah . Well , I if if this is {disfmarker} if you are ready to do that , then I think it deserves a one . {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} Okay . {vocalsound} Let's go for one . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Okay . Yeah . Now we have to do the average . {vocalsound} Three , three , six , eight , eleven . {vocalsound} Who is good in math ? {vocalsound} It's two point one seven . Okay . {vocalsound} Two point one seven . That's nice . Two point one seven out of seven . Hmm . I think we have a good good thing . Yeah . Well , that's all I had to say about the evaluation . So it's a good evaluation . So {disfmarker} It seems to be good , yeah . Yeah . Mm . Yeah mm . We have uh {disfmarker} Yeah , two one one seven , we have . So {disfmarker} Yeah . Mm-mm . Yeah . Okay . Thanks . {vocalsound} Okay . So now , it has to fulfil the {vocalsound} financial criterium ? {vocalsound} Financi Ah-ha . So , I have an {disfmarker} Here . Um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Energy . So so how many batteries do we need ? Uh , we use bat One battery . One battery ? Okay , Yep . so two . Good . Why two ? Oh , we just need one , I guess . {vocalsound} Say no . No , ne never install . Uh-huh . {vocalsound} Two batteries or one ? {vocalsound} Oh . No , number is one . We need only one battery . Yeah yeah , Only one . but the price is two . Oh , number . No , no . But no , no . No , no way . Sorry sorry sorry . I'm sorry . No , uh you just {disfmarker} Number , number . Number . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Oh . Yeah . You never use uh Excel ? {vocalsound} No , never . {vocalsound} How {disfmarker} Good . {vocalsound} What what's the limit ? {vocalsound} {vocalsound} H {vocalsound} {vocalsound} It's twelve bucks . Uh , it's it's okay that I don't know , 'cause uh it's not my field . Twelve bucks . Okay , Twelve bucks . now {disfmarker} Mm-hmm . Twelve and a half , I think . Check that number also . {vocalsound} So we {disfmarker} Okay . {vocalsound} Okay , electronics . We have sample chip . So {disfmarker} Uh , like simple chip , yeah . It's a simple chip ? So , yeah . Simple chip , okay . One . Yeah . Four buttons at least . Okay . Okay . {vocalsound} And then we have the t sample speaker sensor for speech recognition . {vocalsound} And for the {disfmarker} One also . Yeah , one to one . One or two ? One ? Yeah , one . Okay . So the case , which one uh is it in the end ? Yeah , I think we will go for a single curve , no ? Let's do a single curve . Oh , is {gap} {disfmarker} It's it's flat . {vocalsound} Oh . {vocalsound} Oh , okay . It's flat , and curved . I thought you can curve It's flat . {vocalsound} {gap} somebody . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} But it is flat , It's curvable . {vocalsound} you {disfmarker} Look . It's curvable , but it's not curved . {vocalsound} Maybe there is a supplement for that {gap} , no ? Mm-hmm . It's only {gap} curve ? Oh see , I I think {vocalsound} that the the price is this one . Okay , let's go . Yeah . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} This {disfmarker} Okay , Yeah , yeah . you d {vocalsound} Don't chip on me . We tried , we tried . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Oh , okay . Oh . Titanium . So , what is it ? T titanium ? Mm-hmm . Mm . Mm , that's expensive . {vocalsound} Mm-mm . Mm-hmm . Mm . {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} But she wanted u the {vocalsound} fudge titanium . Okay . {vocalsound} Yeah , well {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Let's stick to s titan . I think it's five , but {disfmarker} {vocalsound} you don't say {gap} . {vocalsound} Special colour ? Well , n Why three ? No , only one , no ? No because uh {disfmarker} Mm . Why three ? Oh , sorry . Again , I'm {disfmarker} {gap} {disfmarker} See it . Um {disfmarker} Yeah . {vocalsound} Special colour , Interface . or it's only on the {disfmarker} Oh . Yes , in L_C_D_ display . Yeah , but {vocalsound} there is no {vocalsound} colour here . Ok Yeah , an Yeah . So I put it here . Push-button . So the L_C_D_ {disfmarker} How many push-button ? Scro Three or two ? Uh , two . Two . Is there {disfmarker} The scroll-wheel , okay . Yeah . Yeah . {vocalsound} One scroll wheel {vocalsound} . It's going to be expensive . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} One L_C_D_ displayed . Okay . Um {disfmarker} That's that's not {disfmarker} That's all ? We choose this one , and not this one . Yeah . No . Oh , I think , no it's {disfmarker} Yeah , it's cheaper . Uh , is it a scroll wheel and pe push button , th this centre one ? Or only a scroll-wheel . Yeah . Only scroll wheel . Or only only scroll wheel , okay . Yeah mm . So {disfmarker} {vocalsound} You try to s {vocalsound} {vocalsound} You are trying to make make up {disfmarker} {vocalsound} make us up . No , no , no . It's already {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Because {vocalsound} how do you do to {vocalsound} y select ? {vocalsound} Ah . No , but you select with the two d the other two buttons , Yeah , I mean you you go on the location with your scroll wheel Y ye no ? That's true . and then you {disfmarker} Yeah . Yeah . Then it automatically {disfmarker} we can just do like you feel , it goes . And it will activate {disfmarker} Yeah . Stay longer . Okay . It should stay . Yeah . Oops . {vocalsound} Um , plus , yeah , it's {disfmarker} price is really {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Okay , okay . Um {disfmarker} Special colours , yeah . Mm-hmm . For buttons . Okay . No , Yeah , buttons and strawberries . buttons just normal . Yeah . Special form . You you have all of these , no ? {vocalsound} She's very hard on this . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Mm maybe n not this one but {disfmarker} Special colour ? Yeah . No . Special material ? That's for buttons . Uh , we have titan But buttons are standard . Yeah , buttons are the standard buttons . Yeah . It's only buttons , these . Yeah , so {disfmarker} Nothing special . Yeah . Okay . So we are at seventeen dot eight . Not special colours an interest in ? No , the colour is in the L_C_D_ . {vocalsound} And buttons are not colourised ? They are m Mm , hmm , I no . I think uh because you can just go for a good colours . We can just use this red . Yeah , and uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} It's {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Boo-hoo . {vocalsound} It's already too expensive . {vocalsound} Apparently . Yeah . So what is {disfmarker} Are we supposed to cut things out now ? Yeah . Mm . Uh , until we get twelve fifty . Mm-hmm . Mm . {vocalsound} Oh . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} So think of what we can cut uh here . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Well , if I look at what is the most expensive things , uh it's the L_C_D_ Sample speaker . and the speaker . Yeah . Apparently , we have to choose one or the other . {vocalsound} Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Well , as you may know there's some research done in the field of producing energy from mechanical eng , I mean , producing electricity from mechanical energy . So , the point is that when you take device and push the button , you produce enough energy But you don't need a battery ? to make electricity . Yeah , that you don't need a battery . So , it's something like hand dynamo robot . A real high-tech version of it . Mm-hmm . But um So that would {disfmarker} it's like the hand dynamo , no ? Maybe the jog wheel can be like kind of hand So , but if we select the hand dynamo it's okay , we only {disfmarker} {gap} is {disfmarker} We we win one . Okay , Yeah . That's already that . Uh it's a it's a beginning . Okay , let's do that . Okay . Why not . Yeah . Let's do that . So {disfmarker} One here and here . Yeah , just remo 'Kay . And I propose to {disfmarker} S So uh , about chips . Advanced chip on print , right ? Mm-hmm . So , put minus one there , please . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Mm . {vocalsound} I'm not sure if this is legal . Yeah . {vocalsound} That's right . {vocalsound} Why not ? Uh , no . And ? And ? M maybe minus uh three , no ? {vocalsound} Yeah . No . {vocalsound} So , was there result ? No , no . It's not {disfmarker} Okay , let's see . {vocalsound} Mm-hmm . Mm . Let's have a look . It's not changing , no ? Why ? It {disfmarker} you don't Yeah , yeah , yeah , if {disfmarker} Click somewhere , you'll see features . Oops . Yes , it does . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} So {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Maybe put minus two , so it looks uh {vocalsound} more reasonable . {vocalsound} Yeah . Why not . Yeah , anyway {disfmarker} Oh , sorry . Minus . No , minus two . Mm-hmm . Nobody will know . Mm . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} It's not recorded , is it ? Good . {vocalsound} Okay , we're on time . {vocalsound} Okay . {vocalsound} Good . So now on , we can increase our {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Still you have two more . {vocalsound} Oh , we can put uh a hand dynamo and a battery if you want . Maybe we can use it for our party . {vocalsound} Oh . And a battery and a battery , yeah . Yeah . Both its it's cool . {vocalsound} Yeah , yeah . No , now we are exp exceeding I think . Now it's fancy , Mm . let's add one instead of two . {vocalsound} Yeah , that {disfmarker} It {disfmarker} Is it ? {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah , yeah y {vocalsound} I think we're exceeding now . No , but point five point three . We have to remove the {disfmarker} Okay . Uh , it's better . I think they are counting uh {disfmarker} Yeah . Mm . It's maximum Is really strict ? We would prefer , and don't have to {disfmarker} Yeah , yeah . Oh . yeah . Maximum is maximum . Uh {disfmarker} Oh yeah . So , remove one of them . Yeah . Okay . Okay , we're uh on target . Uh , mm-mm . Yeah . Mm . Okay . Mm . So {vocalsound} target reached . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} I'm just curious to see this {vocalsound} Ho {vocalsound} uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} my {disfmarker} {vocalsound} address chip on print . {vocalsound} It's um English uh {vocalsound} {disfmarker} Yeah . {vocalsound} Trick {vocalsound} . Uh , I would say it's the Russian trick , but {vocalsound} Yeah , but uh {gap} is uh English . So {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {disfmarker} Anyway {disfmarker} {vocalsound} No , Oh . Uh {disfmarker} Mm . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Well , I don't know . they may have some their origins , strange origins {disfmarker} I don't know . I am not sure who was programming this calculator , you know . 'Cause uh {disfmarker} I wonder if we put A_ or B_ somewhere instead of a number . Mm , let's try . {vocalsound} No , no , no . {vocalsound} And we can discuss all these things in our party . Let's finish this meeting instead . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Okay . {vocalsound} I save it uh {disfmarker} What else ? Okay , so next mm {disfmarker} {vocalsound} No . No , that's yours . This is right . Sorry . Okay , 'Kay . so finance , that's done . Are the cost under twelve ? {vocalsound} Mm yeah , very much . Yes . Project evaluation , good . {vocalsound} Okay . So now {disfmarker} Next slide . {vocalsound} Project process . {vocalsound} We have to make um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Safe uh asse uh safe assessment . Yeah . Yeah . Mm . See mm how {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Are we a good team ? Mm . {vocalsound} Okay . Yeah , I think we've listened to everybody . Mm-hmm . Everybody could say what they thought . Mm . And uh {disfmarker} Is there enough room for creativity ? Yeah , yeah . {vocalsound} Yeah , yeah . Mm . And you . {vocalsound} Yeah . Yeah . When we see the results , there is no doubt there {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Yeah , it's really {disfmarker} Mm . {vocalsound} Oh . {vocalsound} Okay . {vocalsound} Well , project evaluation . {vocalsound} Maybe a lack of leadership ? {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah . M maybe not , huh ? Team-work , very strong , I would say . Yeah , our team-work is really strong . Team-work , no problem . Means . Whiteboard , digital pens . Oh , we still {gap} , I guess . What was the {disfmarker} Oh yeah , what was good ? Everything . What was bad ? Yeah , I think white-board is useful . Digital pens , useful . Hmm . New ideas found ? {vocalsound} So , you say , is there sheep ? {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} Luck . {vocalsound} Okay .

Thank you . {gap} thank you to you . Mm .",
        "summarize": "It was the last meeting of the group and focused on detail design. First, the user interface designer displayed the appearance and the texture of the product with a working prototype. After that, the industrial designer gave some technical specifications on the product. In the product evaluation that included several criteria, the controller got an average score of two point one seven, which implied it was good. When it came to the quotation of product components, the original one was seventeen dot eight dollars, which was apparently over budget. After some discussions about battery and operations on the calculator, the group finally cut the cost down to under twelve dollars. Finally, they did some self-assessment and celebrated the completion of the project."

        "transcript": "Alright . So are you {disfmarker} So . Are we going ? It is uh , must be February fifteenth . Yeah . Yu I think the date 's written in there , yep . And actually if everyone could cross out the R - nine next to \" Session \" , and write MR eleven . Yeah . Yeah . We didn't have a front - end meeting today . And let 's remember also to make sure that one 's {comment} gets marked as unread , unused . OK . MR eleven . MR eleven . That sounds like a spy code . Mmm . OK . So . There 's lots of clicking I 'm sure as I 'm trying to get this to work {pause} correctly . Agenda . Any agenda items today ? I wanna talk a little bit about getting {disfmarker} how we 're gonna to get people to edit bleeps , parts of the meeting that they don't want to include . What I 've done so far , and I wanna get some opinions on , how to {disfmarker} how to finish it up . OK . I wanna ask about um , some aud audio monitoring on some of the {pause} um {pause} well some of the equipment . In particular , the {disfmarker} well uh , that 's just what I wanna ask . OK audio monitoring , Jane . Ba - based on some of the tran uh {disfmarker} i In listening to {pause} some of these meetings that have already been recorded there are sometimes big spikes on particular things , and in pact {disfmarker} in fact this one I 'm talking on is one of {disfmarker} of the ones that showed up in one of the meetings , Oh really . so I {disfmarker} \" Spikes \" , you mean like uh , instantaneous click type spikes , or {disfmarker} ? Mm - hmm . Yeah . Spikes ? Clicks . Yeah . Hmm . Yeah . Huh . And I don't know what the e electronics is but . Yeah . Yeah . Well , I think it 's Touching . uh , it {disfmarker} it could be a number of things . Yeah . It could be touching and fiddling , and the other thing is that it could {disfmarker} the fact that it 's on a wired mike is suspicious . It might be a connector . Oh , OK . Well maybe {disfmarker} Then we don't really have to talk about that as an {disfmarker} You could try an experiment and say \" OK , I 'm about to test for spikes \" , I {disfmarker} I take that off the agenda . and then wiggle the thing there , and then go and when they go to transcribe it , it could , ask them to come and get you . Yeah . Right . \" Come get me when you transcribe this and see if there 's spikes . \" Oh that {disfmarker} Um . Well , OK . No I 'm just {disfmarker}  I mean , were this a professional audio recording , {vocalsound} what we would do {disfmarker} {comment} what you would do is {disfmarker} in testing it is , you would actually do all this wiggling and make sure that {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} that things are not giving that kind of performance . And if they are , then they can't be used . Right . So . Um . Let 's see . I guess {pause} I would like to have a discussion about you know where we are on uh , recording , transcription you know , basically you know where we are on the corpus . Good . And then um , the other thing which I would like to talk about which is a real meta - quest , I think , deal is , uh , agendas . So maybe I 'll {disfmarker} I 'll start with that actually . Uh , um . {vocalsound} Andreas brought up the fact that he would kinda like to know , if possible , what we were gonna be talking about because he 's sort of peripherally involved to this point , and if there 's gonna be a topic about {disfmarker} discussion about something that he uh strongly cares about then he would come and {disfmarker} And I think part of {disfmarker} part of his motivation with this is that he 's trying to help us out , in the {disfmarker} because of uh the fact that the meetings are {disfmarker} are tending to become reasonably large now on days when everybody shows up and so , he figures he could help that out by not showing {disfmarker} Mmm . and {disfmarker} and I 'm sure help out his own time . by not showing up if it 's a meeting that he 's {disfmarker} he 's {disfmarker} So , uh in order {disfmarker} I 'd {disfmarker} I think that this is a wish on his part . Uh . It 's actually gonna be hard because it seems like a lot of times uh things come up that are unanticipated and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} Right . But um , we could try anyway , uh , do another try at coming up with the agenda uh , at some point before the meeting , uh , say the day before . Well maybe it would be a good idea for one of us to {pause} like on Wednesday , or Tuesday send out a reminder for people to send in agenda items . Yeah . OK . You {disfmarker} you wanna volunteer to do that ? Sure . OK . Alright so we 'll send out agenda request . Let me Uh . That 'll be {disfmarker} I think that 'll help {disfmarker} I 'll put that on my spare brain or it will not {pause} get done . That 'll help a lot , actually . Yeah , I have to tell you for the uh {disfmarker} for the admin meeting that we have , Lila does that um every time before an admin meeting . And uh , she ends up getting the agenda requests uh , uh ten minutes before the meeting . But {disfmarker} but {disfmarker} {comment} But . Uh . {comment} But we can try . Maybe it 'll work . Mmm . Yeah . Maybe . Weirder things have happened . Yeah . I 'm wondering if he were to just , uh , specify particular topics , I mean . Maybe we 'd be able to meet that request of his a little more . I would {disfmarker} I would also guess that as we get more into processing the data and things like that there 'll be more things of interest to him . Well then {disfmarker} Yeah . Actually it {disfmarker} This {disfmarker} this maybe brings up another topic which is um {disfmarker} So we 're done with that topic . The other topic I was thinking of was the sta status on microphones and channels , and all that . Yeah , actually I {disfmarker} I was going to say we need to {pause} talk about that too . Yeah . Why {disfmarker} why don't we do that . OK . Um , the new microphones , the two new ones are in . Um . {pause} And they are being assembled as we speak , I hope . And I didn't bring my car today so I 'm gonna pick them up tomorrow . Um , and then the other question I was thinking about is {disfmarker} well , a couple things . First of all , if the other headsets are a lot more comfortable , we should probably just go ahead and get them . So we 'll have to evaluate that when they come in ,  and get people 's opinions on {disfmarker} on what they think of them . Um , then the other question I had is maybe we should get another wireless . Another wireless setup . I mean it 's expensive , but it does seem to be {pause} better than the wired . So how many channels do you get to have in a wireless setup ? Um , well , I 'm pretty sure that you can daisy - chain them together so what we would do is replace the wired mikes with wireless . So we currently have one base station with six wireless mike , possibility of six wireless receivers , and apparently you can chain those together . And so we could replace our wired mikes with wireless if we bought another base station and more wireless mikes . So , um . And {disfmarker} So , you know it 's still , it 's fifteen minus six . So let 's see we {disfmarker} Right ? So we could have up to nine . And right now we can have up to six . Right . And we have five , we 're getting one more . Yeah . And it 's um , about nine hundred dollars for the base station , and then eight hundred per channel . Oh . So yeah so the only {disfmarker} Beyond the mike {disfmarker} the cost of the mikes the only thing is the base station that 's nine hundred dollars . Right . Oh , we should do it . OK . OK , so I 'll look into how you daisy - chain them and {disfmarker} and then just go ahead and order them . Yeah . Yeah . I don't quite understand how that {disfmarker} how that works , . If {disfmarker} So we 're not increasing the number of channels . OK . No , we 're just replacing the wired {disfmarker} the two wired that are still working , OK . I see . along with a couple of the wired that aren't working , one of the wired that 's not working , with a wireless . Yeah . Three wireds work , Basically we found {disfmarker} right ? I {disfmarker} I guess three wireds work , yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . But we 've had more problems with that . Yep . And that sort of bypasses the whole {disfmarker} the whole Jimbox thing and all that . Right . And so um , we {disfmarker} we seem to have uh , a reliable way of getting the data in , which is through the ra Sony radio mikes , as long as we 're conscious about the batteries . Right . That seems to be the key issue . Everyone 's battery OK ? I checked them this morning , they should be . OK . Yeah . Um , {vocalsound} That 's the only thing with them . But the quality seems really good and {disfmarker} Um I heard from UW that they 're {disfmarker} they 're uh very close to getting their , uh setup purchased . They 're {disfmarker} they 're {disfmarker} they 're buying something that you can just sort of buy off the shelf . Well we should talk to them about it because I know that SRI is also in the process of looking at stuff , and so , you know , what we should try to keep everyone {disfmarker} on the same page with that . Yeah . SRI , really ? Yeah . Oh . They got sa apparent Well , Maybe {pause} this needs to be bleeped out ? I have no clue . Uh , I don't know . I don't know how much of it 's public . Probably we shouldn't {disfmarker} probably we shouldn't talk about funding stuff . Right . Yeah . But anyway there 's {disfmarker} there 's {disfmarker} there 's uh , uh other activities that are going on there and {disfmarker} and uh {disfmarker} and NIST and UW . So . Um . But {disfmarker} but yeah I thin I think that at least the message we can tell other people is that our experience is {disfmarker} is quite positive with the Sony , Right . uh , radio - mikes . Now the one thing that you have said that actually concerns me a little is you 're talking about changing the headsets meaning changing the connector , which means some hand - soldering or something , right ? Uh , no , we 're having the {disfmarker} them do it . No ? So it 's so hand - soldering it , but I 'm not doing it . Oh . So , they {disfmarker} they charge OK . Nothing against you and your hand - soldering right . but {disfmarker} You 've never seen my hand - soldering . But uh , a as I said they 're coming in . Uh , OK , so that 's being done professionally and {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I mean {disfmarker} Yeah . Yeah . I mean . Yeah . As professionally as I guess you can get it done . Well , it could {disfmarker} if they do a lot of it , it 's {disfmarker} I mean i it 's just their repair shop . Right ? Their maintenance people . Well , we 'll see what it {disfmarker} it 's like . Yep . That {disfmarker} tha that can be quite good . Th - this {disfmarker} Yeah , OK . Good . Yeah . So let 's go with that . And , I mean we 'll see , tomorrow , you know , what it looks like . Uh , Yeah . So , um , uh , Dave isn't here but he was going to start working on some things with the digits . Uh , so he 'll be interested in what 's going on with that . I guess {disfmarker} Was {disfmarker} the decision last time was that the {disfmarker} the uh transcribers were going to be doing stuff with the digits as well ? Has that started , or is that {disfmarker} ? Mm - hmm . Yeah . Uh , it would be to use his interface and I was going to meet with him today about that . Right , so , the decision was that Jane did not want the transcribers to be doing any of the paperwork . So I did the {disfmarker} all that last week . So all the {disfmarker} all the forms are now {pause} on the computer . And uh , then I have a bunch of scripts that we 'll read those and let the uh {pause} transcribers use different tools . And I just want to talk to Jane about how we transition to using those . Mm - hmm . So he has a nice set up that they {disfmarker} it w it will be efficient for them to do that . OK . I {disfmarker} I don't think it 'll take too long . So anyway {disfmarker} So , you know , just uh , a matter of a few days I suspect . So anyway I think we {disfmarker} we have at least one uh , user for the digits once they get done , which will be Dave . Right . I 've already done five or six {pause} sets . OK . So if he wanted to , you know , just have a few to start with , he could . You know , and I also have a bunch of scripts that will , like , generate P - files and run recognition on them also . Yeah , he might {disfmarker} he might be asking {disfmarker} Right . OK . Uh , is Dave {disfmarker} I don't know if Dave is on the list , if he 's invited to these meetings , uh if he knows . I don't tend to get an invitation myself for them even . No , no . Uh , we don't have a active one but I 'll make sure he 's on the list . Yeah . Should we call him ? I mean is he {disfmarker} d is he definitely not available today ? I don't know . Should I call his office and see ? He was in . I mean , he 's still taking classes , so uh , he may well have conflicts . Uh , well i it 's uh {disfmarker} Yeah . Yeah . Yeah , he was in {pause} s He wasn't there at cof Yeah , so this might be a conflict for him . Yeah . Yeah . OK . OK . Uh , so . Yeah didn't he say his signal - processing class was like {pause} Tuesdays and Thursdays ? I think he has a class . Yeah . Yeah . He might have . Oh well , whatever . You talking about David Gelbart ? Oh , OK . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Yes . Yeah , I think he 's taking two twenty - five A which is now . Yeah . So . Yeah . OK . OK . So , that 's why we 're not seeing him . OK . Uh , transcriptions , uh , beyond the digits , where we are , and so on . OK . And the {disfmarker} and the recordings also , Um {disfmarker} just where we are . Yeah . Well , so um , should we {disfmarker} we don't wan wanna do the recording status first , or {disfmarker} ? Well , we have about thirty - two hours uh as of , I guess a week and a half ago , so we probably now have about thirty - five hours . And {disfmarker} and that 's {disfmarker} that 's uh {disfmarker} How much of that is digits ? It 's uh {disfmarker} that 's including digits , That 's including digits . right ? I haven't separated it out so I have no clue how much of that is digits . So {disfmarker} Yeah . So anyway there 's at least probably thirty hours , or something of {disfmarker} There 's got to be more than thirty hour {disfmarker} Mmm . Of {disfmarker} of non - digits ? i it couldn't {disfmarker} of {disfmarker} Of non - digits . Yeah , absolutely . I mean , the digits don't take up that much time . Yeah , yeah . OK . OK , and the transcribers h I , uh , don't have the exact numbers , but I {pause} think it would come to about eleven hours that are finished uh , transcribing from them right now . The next step is to {disfmarker} that I 'm working on is to insure that the data are clean first , and then channelized . What I mean by clean is that they 're spell - checked , that the mark - up is consistent all the way throughout , and also that we now incorporate these additional conventions that uh , Liz requested in terms of um , um {pause} in terms of having a s a systematic handling of numbers , and acronyms which I hadn't been specific about . Um , for example , i they 'll say uh \" ninety - two \" . And you know , so how {disfmarker} you could {disfmarker} Nine two , e Exactly . right . So if you just say \" nine two \" , the {disfmarker} there are many s ways that could have been expressed . An - and I just had them {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I mean , a certain number of them did put the words down , but now we have a convention which also involves having it followed by , um , a gloss th and things . You know , Jane ? Mm - hmm . Um , one suggestion and you may already be doing this , but I 've noticed in the past that when I 've gone through transcriptions and you know in {disfmarker} in order to build lexicons and things , if you um , just take all the transcriptions and separate them into words and then alphabetize them , {comment} a lot of times just scanning down that list you 'll find a lot of {pause} inconsistencies and mis Misspelled . Yeah . You 're talking about the type token frequency listings , and I use those too . Y you mean just uh {pause} on each {disfmarker} on each line there 's a one word right ? It 's one token from the {disfmarker} from the corpus . Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . Yeah , those are e extremely efficient and I and I {disfmarker} I agree that 's a very good use of it . Oh so you already have that , OK . Well that 's {disfmarker} that 's a way {disfmarker} that 's {disfmarker} You know , the spell - check basically does that but {disfmarker} but in addition {disfmarker} yes , that 's {disfmarker} that 's exactly the strategy I wanna do in terms of locating these things which are you know colloquial spoken forms which aren't in the lexicon . Mm - hmm . Cuz a lot of times they 'll appear next to each other , and uh , Exactly . And then you ca then you can do a s Yeah . i in alphabetized lists , they 'll appear next to each other and {disfmarker} and so it makes it easier . Absolutely . I agree . That 's a very good {disfmarker} that 's a very good uh , suggestion . And that was {disfmarker} that 's my strategy for handling a lot of these things , in terms of things that need to be glossed . I didn't get to that point but {disfmarker} So there are numbers , then there are acronyms , and then um , there 's a {disfmarker} he she wants the uh , actually a {disfmarker} an explicit marker of what type of comment this is , so i curly b inside the curly brackets I 'm gonna put either \" VOC \" for vocalized , like cough or like laugh or whatever , \" NONVOC \" for door - slam , and \" GLOSS \" for things that have to do with {disfmarker} if they said a s a spoken form with this {disfmarker} m this pronunciation error . Right . I already had that convention Oh that 's great . but I {disfmarker} I haven't been asking these people to do it systematically cuz I think it most {disfmarker} ha most efficiently handled by uh {disfmarker} by a {disfmarker} a filter . That was what I was always planing on . So that , you know you get a whole long list {disfmarker} exactly what you 're saying , you get a whole list of things that say \" curly bracket laugh curly bracket \" , Mm - hmm . then y you know it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} You {disfmarker} you risk less error if you handle it by a filter , than if you have this transcriber ch laboriously typing in sort of a VOC space , Yeah . so man So many ways that error prone . Right . Right . So , um , {vocalsound} um I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm going to convert that via a filter , into these tagged uh , subcategorized comments , and same thing with you know , we see you get a subset when you do what you 're saying , Mm - hmm . you end up with a s with uh , you 're collapsing across a frequency you just have the tokens Mm - hmm . and you can um , have a filter which more efficiently makes those changes . But the numbers and acronyms have to be handled by hand , because , you know I mean , jus You don't know what they could be . Yeah . Yeah now TIMIT 's clear um {pause} and PLP is clear but uh there are things that are not so well known , in {disfmarker} or {disfmarker} or have variant {disfmarker} u u uses like the numbers you can say \" nine two \" or you can say \" ninety - two \" , So how are you doing the {disfmarker} and uh I 'd handle the numbers individually . How are you doing the uh , acronyms so if I say PZM what would it appear on the transcript ? It would be separate {disfmarker} The letters would be separated in space OK . and potentially they 'll have a curly bracket thing afterwards e but I 'm not sure if that 's necessary , clarifying what it is , Mm - hmm . so gloss of {pause} whatever . Right . I don't know if that 's really necessary to do that . Maybe it 's a nice thing to do because of it then indicating this is uh , a step away from i indicating that it really is intentional that those spaces are there , and indicating why they 're there to indicate that it 's uh {vocalsound} the you know , {comment} uh enumerated , or i Mm - hmm . it 's not a good way of saying {disfmarker} but it 's {disfmarker} it 's the {vocalsound} specific uh way of stating these {disfmarker} these letters . Right . So it sounds good . And so anyway , the clean {disfmarker} those are those things and then channelized is to then um , get it into this multichannel format . And at that point then it 's ready for use by Liz and Don . But that 's been my top priority {disfmarker} beyond getting it tanel channelized , the next step is to work on tightening up the boundaries of the time bins . Yeah . Right . And uh , Thilo had a {disfmarker} e e a breakthrough with this {disfmarker} this last week in terms of getting the channel - based um uh s s speech - nonspeech segmentation um , up and running and I haven't {disfmarker} I haven't been able to use that yet cuz I 'm working s re this is my top priority {disfmarker} get the data clean , and channelized . I actually gave Have you also been doing spot checks , Jane ? Oh yes . Okay , good . Well you see that 's part of the cleaning process . I spent um actually um I have a segment of ten minutes that was transcribed by two of our transcribers , Oh good . Good . and I went through it last night , it 's {disfmarker} it 's almost spooky how similar these are , word for word . And there are some differences in commas cuz commas I {disfmarker} I left them discretion at commas . Right . Uh {disfmarker} and so because it 's not part of our st of our ne needed conventions . Mm - hmm . And um , and {disfmarker} so they 'll be a difference in commas , but it 's word - by - word the same , in {disfmarker} in huge patches of the data . And I have t ten minute stretch where I can {disfmarker} where I can show that . And {disfmarker} and sometimes it turns out that one of these transcribers has a better ear for technical jargon , and the other one has a better ear for colloquial speech . So um , the one i i the colloquial speech person picked up \" gobbledy - gook \" . Hmm . And the other one didn't . And on this side , this one 's picking up things like \" neural nets \" and the one that 's good on the sp o on th the vocabulary on the uh colloquial didn't . Right . When {disfmarker} for the person who missed \" gobbledy - gook \" what did they put ? It was an interesting approximation , put in parentheses , cuz I have this convention that , i if they 're not sure what it was , they put it in parentheses . Oh . So they tried to approximate it , but it was {disfmarker} Oh good . it was spelled GABBL {disfmarker} Sort of how it sounds . Yeah . Yes . More of an attempt to {disfmarker} I mean apparently it was very clear to her that these {disfmarker} the a this {disfmarker} this was a sound {disfmarker} these are the sounds , It was a technical term that she didn't recognize , Yeah . but {disfmarker} Yeah . But she knew that she didn't know it . Maybe it was a technical ter exactly . But she {disfmarker} even though her technical perception is just really {disfmarker} uh you know I 've {disfmarker} I 'm tempted to ask her if she 's taken any courses in this area or if she 's taken cognitive science courses Right . then cuz \" neural nets \" and {disfmarker} oh she has some things that are {disfmarker} oh \" downsampled \" , she got that right . Hmm . And some of these are rather {pause} uh unexpected . Obscure , yeah . But ch ten solid uh {disfmarker} m ch s chunk of ten solid minutes where they both coded the same data . And {disfmarker} and again the main track that you 're working with is elev eleven hours ? And um {disfmarker} Is that right ? Yes exactly . Yeah , OK . And that 's part of this {disfmarker} Eleven hours . Is that {disfmarker} is that {disfmarker} that including digits ? Yeah . Yes it is . So let 's say roughly {pause} ten hours or so of {disfmarker} Mm - hmm . I mean it 's probably more than that but {disfmarker} but with {disfmarker} of {disfmarker} of non - digits . Yeah . It 'd be more than that because I {disfmarker} my recollection is the minutes {disfmarker} that da digits don't take more than half a minute . Per person . Oh , OK . But um {pause} the {disfmarker} the total set that I gave them is twelve hours of tape , Oh , I see . But they haven't gotten to the end of that yet . Oh , I see . So they 're still working {disfmarker} some of them are {disfmarker} Two of them are still working on completing that . Yeah . Boy , they 're moving right along . Yeah . Yeah . They are . Mm - hmm . They 're very efficient . There 're some who have more hours that they devote to it than others . Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . Yeah . So what {disfmarker} what {disfmarker} what 's the deal with {disfmarker} with your {disfmarker} The channel u thing ? Yeah . Oh , it 's just uh , I ran the recognizer {disfmarker} uh , the {pause} {comment} speech - nonspeech detector on different channels and , it 's just in uh {disfmarker} in this new multi - channel format and output , and I just gave one {disfmarker} one meeting to {disfmarker} to Liz who wanted to {disfmarker} to try it for {disfmarker} for the recognizer Oh , I see . as uh , apparently the recognizer had problems with those long chunks of speech , which took too much memory or whatever , Right . and so {pause} she {disfmarker} she will try that I think Yeah . and {disfmarker} I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm working on it . So , I hope {disfmarker} Is this anything different than the HMM system you were using before ? Yeah . No . Uh , I {pause} mmm , use some {disfmarker} some different features but not {disfmarker} not {disfmarker} Mm - hmm . The basic thing is this HMM base . So there 's still no {disfmarker} no knowledge using different channels at the same time . There is some , uh as the energy is normalized across channels You know what I mean ? Across all of them . yeah . OK . So . But basically that 's one of the main changes . Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . What are some of the other features ? Besides the energy ? You said you 're trying some different features , or something . Oh I just uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Mmm , I just use um our loudness - based things now as they {disfmarker} before there were {disfmarker} they were some in {disfmarker} in the log domain and I {disfmarker} I changed this to the {disfmarker} to the {disfmarker} Cu - Cube root ? Yeah . To {disfmarker} No , I changed this to the {disfmarker} to the {disfmarker} to the loudness thingy with the {disfmarker} with the Hmm . Ah . how do you call it ? I 'm not sure . With the , uh {disfmarker} Fletcher Munson ? No . I 'm not sure about the term . Oh , OK . Uh , I 'll look it up . And say it to you . Yeah , alright . Uh , OK , and {disfmarker} Yeah . That 's {disfmarker} that 's basically the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the thing . Yeah , and I {disfmarker} and I tried t to normalize uh {disfmarker} uh the features , there 's loudness and modified loudness , um , within one channel , OK . because they 're , {vocalsound} yeah to {disfmarker} to be able to distinguish between foreground and background speech . And it works quite well . But , not always . Uh - huh . Uh - huh . So . OK . Good . Um , let 's see . I think the uh {disfmarker} Were {disfmarker} were you basically done with the transcription part ? So I guess the next thing is this uh {disfmarker} bleep editing . Right . So the {disfmarker} The idea is that we need to have {disfmarker} We need to provide the transcripts to every participant of every meeting to give them an opportunity to bleep out sections they don't want . So I 've written a bunch of tools that will generate web pages , uh with the transcription in it so that they can click on them and piece {disfmarker} pieces and they can scroll through and read them , and then they can check on each one if they want it excluded . And then , it 's a form , HTML form , so they can submit it and it will end up sending me email with the times that they want excluded . And so , uh , some of the questions on this is what do we do about the privacy issue . And so I thought about this a little bit and I think the best way to do it is every participant will have a password , Yeah . a single password . Each person will have a single password , user name and password . And then each meeting , we 'll only allow the participants who were at that meeting to look at it . And that way each person only has to remember one password . I {disfmarker} I can't help but wonder if this is maybe a little more elaborate than is needed . I mean if people have {disfmarker} Uh , I mean , for me I would actually want to have some pieces of paper that had the transcription and I would sort of flip through it . And then {pause} um {pause} if I thought it was OK , I 'd say \" it 's OK \" . Mm - hmm . And , I {disfmarker} uh {disfmarker} I mean it depends how this really ends up working out , but I guess my thought was that the occasion of somebody wondering whether something was OK or not and needing to listen to it was gonna be extremely rare . Right , I mean so th th th the fact that you could listen to it over the web is a minor thing that I had already done for {pause} other reasons . OK . And so that {disfmarker} that 's a minor part of it , I just wanted some web interface so that people {disfmarker} you didn't actually have to send everyone the text . So m what my intention to do is that as the transcripts become ready , um {pause} I would take them , and generate the web pages and send email to every participant or contact them using the contact method they wanted , and just uh , tell them , \" here 's the web page \" , um , \" you need a password \" . So th th question number one is how do we distribute the passwords , and question number two is how else do we wanna provide this information if they want it . That 's {disfmarker} I think what I was sort of saying is that if you just say {vocalsound} \" here is a {disfmarker} here is {disfmarker} \" I mean this maybe it sounds paleolithic but {disfmarker} but I just thought if you handed them some sheets of paper , that said , uh , \" here 's what was said in this transcription is it OK with you ? and if it is , here 's this other sheet of paper that you sign that says that it 's OK \" . I think that um there are a subset of people who will want printouts that we can certainly provide . And then they 'd hand it back to you . But certainly I wouldn't want a printout . These are big , and I would much rather be {pause} ha be able to just sit and leaf through it . You find it easier to go through a large {disfmarker} I mean how do you read books ? Well I certainly read books by hand . But for something like this , I think it 's easier to do it on the web . Really ? I mean , it {disfmarker} Cuz you 're gonna get , you know , if I {disfmarker} I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm in a bunch of meetings and I don't wanna get a stack of these . I wanna just be able to go to {disfmarker} go to the web site {comment} and visit it as I want . Going to a web site is easy , but flipping through a hundred pounds {disfmarker} a hundred pages of stuff is not easy on the web . Well , I don't think it 's that much harder than , paper . So . Really ? I have one question . So are you thinking that um the person would have a transcript and go strictly from the transcript ? Because I {disfmarker} I do think that there 's a benefit to being able to hear the tone of voice and the {disfmarker} So here 's the way I was imagining it , and maybe I 'm wrong , Yeah . but the way I imagined it was that um , the largest set of people is gonna go \" oh yeah , I didn't say anything funny in that meeting just go ahead , where 's the {disfmarker} where 's the release ? \" And then there 'll be a subset of people , right ? {disfmarker} OK there 's {disfmarker} I mean think of who it is we 've been recording mostly . Yeah . OK there 'll be a subset of people , who um , will say uh \" well , yeah , I really would like to see that . \" And for them , the easiest way to flip through , if it 's a really large document , I mean unless you 're searching . Searching , of course , should be electronic , but if you 're not {disfmarker} so if you provide some search mechanism you go to every place they said something or something like that , Yeah . but see then we 're getting more elaborate with this thing . Um if {disfmarker} if uh you don't have search mechanisms you just sort of have this really , really long document , I mean whenever I 've had a really , really long document that it was sitting on the web , I 've always ended up printing it out . I mean , so it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} I mean , you {disfmarker} you 're {disfmarker} you 're not necessarily gonna be sitting at the desk all the time , you wanna figure you have a train ride , and there 's all these situations where {disfmarker} where I {disfmarker} I mean , this is how I was imagining it , anyway . And then I figured , that out of that group , there would be a subset who would go \" hmm you know I 'm really not sure about this section here , \" and then that group would need it {disfmarker} S It seems like i if I 'm right in that , it seems like you 're setting it up for the most infrequent case , rather than for the most frequent case . So that uh , now we have to worry about privacy , Well , no fre for the most {disfmarker} we have to worry about all these passwords , for different people For the most frequent case they just say {pause} \" it 's OK \" and then they 're done . And I think {pause} almost everyone would rather do that by email than any other method . Mm - hmm . The other thing too is it seems like {disfmarker} Um , yeah , that 's true . Go ahead . I mean , cuz you don't have to visit the web page if you don't want to . Yeah . I guess {disfmarker} Yeah , I guess we don't need their signature . I guess an email OK is alright . Oh that was another thing I {disfmarker} I had assumed that we didn't need their signature , that it {disfmarker} that an email approval was sufficient . But {pause} I don't actually know . Are {disfmarker} are people going to be allowed to bleep out sections of a meeting where they weren't speaking ? Yes . If someone feels strongly enough about it , then I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I think they should be allowed to do that . I also {disfmarker} mm - hmm . So that means other people are editing what you say ? Uh {pause} I don't know about that . Yeah . I don't know if I like that . Well , the only other choice is that the person would say \" no , don't distribute this meeting at all \" , and I would rather they were able to edit out other people then just say \" don't distribute it at all \" . But th what they signed in the consent form , was something that said you can use my voice . Well , but if {disfmarker} if someone is having a conversation , and you only bleep out one side of it , that 's not sufficient . Right ? Yeah . Yeah , but that 's our decision then . Right ? Um , I don't think so . I mean , because if I object to the conversation . I think it is . If I say \" we were having a conversation , and I consider that conversation private , \" and I consider that your side of it is enough for other people to infer , I wanna be able to bleep out your side . The {disfmarker} I agree that the consent forms were {disfmarker} uh , I cons agree with what Adam 's saying , that {vocalsound} um , the consent form did leave open this possibility that they could edit things which they found offensive whe whether they said them or didn't say them . I see . OK , well , if that 's what it said . And the other thing is from the standpoint of the l of the l I 'm not a law lawyer , but it strikes me that {vocalsound} uh , we wouldn't want someone to say \" oh yes , I was a little concerned about it but {vocalsound} it was too hard to access \" . So I think it 's kind of nice to have this facility to listen to it . Now {disfmarker} in terms of like editing it by hand , I mean I think it 's {disfmarker} i some people would find that easier to specify the bleep part by having a document they edited . But {disfmarker} but it seems to me that sometimes um , you know i if a person had a bad day , and they had a tone in their voice that they didn't really like , you know it 's nice {disfmarker} it 's nice to be able to listen to it and be sure that that was OK . I mean I can certainly provide a printable version if people want it . Um . Um {pause} I mean it 's also a mixture of people , I mean some people are r do their work primarily by sitting at the computer , flipping around the web , and others do not . Yep . Others would consider it {disfmarker} this uh {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a set of skills that they would have to gain . You know ? Well I think most of the people in the meetings are the former . It depends on what meetings . That 's true . So far . So . In the meetings so far , yeah . Yep . But we 're trying to expand this , right ? Right . So I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I actually think that paper is the more universal thing . And that {disfmarker} Well , but if they want to print it out that 's alright . Mm - hmm . Yeah . I think everyone in the meeting can access the web . No , I think we have to be able to print it out . It 's not just if they want to print it out . I {disfmarker} I think {disfmarker} OK , so does that mean that I can't use email ? Or what ? Cuz you could send it through email you 're thinking . I {disfmarker} I th Well , I don't think I {disfmarker} well {disfmarker} we {disfmarker} there was this {disfmarker} well I don't think we can send the text through email because of the privacy issues . No . Good . For security ? Yeah . Yeah , OK good . Right . Um . So giving them , you think a web site to say , \" if you wanna print it out here it is \" , is not sufficient ? Good point .  Yeah . I Certainly for everybody who 's been in the meetings so far it would be sufficient . Yeah , I 'm just thinking for people that that 's not sufficient for , what {disfmarker} the only sufficient thing would be for me to walk up to them and hand it to them . I 'm just wondering about {disfmarker} You could mail it to them . Yeah . Get an a mailing address . Equivalent . But {disfmarker} But I think it 's easier to drop in the box . Just put the button on {disfmarker} on the web page which say \" please send me the {disfmarker} the scripts \" . That 's right . Oh that 's interesting . Yeah . What um {disfmarker} When you display it on the web page , what are {disfmarker} what are you showing them ? Utterances , or {disfmarker} ? Mm - hmm . And so can they bleep within an utterance ? No . Whole utterances only . Whole utterances . And that was just convenience for my sake , that it 's uh , uh it would end up being fairly difficult to edit the transcripts if we would do it at the sub - utterance level . Because this way I can just delete an entire line out of a transcript file rather than have to do it by hand . There 's another aspect to this which maybe {disfmarker} is part of why this is bothering me . Um , I think you 're really trying very hard to make this as convenient as possible for people to do this . Mmm . I mean that 's why I did the web form , because for me that would be my most convenient . I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I understand . I know where you 're going . I think that 's the bad idea . Oh . See because you 're gon you 're {disfmarker} uh {disfmarker} Really . You 're gonna end up with all these little patchy things , whereas really what we want to do is have the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the bias towards letting it go . Because nob you know it {disfmarker} There was a {disfmarker} one or twi once or twice , in the re in the meetings we 've heard , where somebody said something that they might be embarrassed by , but overall people are talking about technical topics . Nobody 's gonna get hurt . Nobody 's being l libeled . You know , this is {disfmarker} this {disfmarker} we 're {disfmarker} we 're covering {disfmarker} We 're playing the lawyer 's game , and we 're playing we 're {disfmarker} we 're {disfmarker} we 're looking for the extreme case . If we really orient it towards that extreme case , make it really easy , we 're gonna end up encouraging a headache . That {disfmarker} I think that 's {disfmarker} I 'm sort of psyching myself out here , I {disfmarker} I 'm trying to {disfmarker} uh {disfmarker} I guess I don't see having a few phrases here and there in a meeting being that mu much of a headache , bleeped out . but I {disfmarker} I think that 's {disfmarker} Well , it 's {disfmarker} So . I think what Morgan 's saying is the easier it is , the more is gonna be bleeped . but i And {disfmarker} and it really depends on what kind of research you 're doing . I think some researchers who are gonna be working with this corpus years from now are really gonna be cursing the fact that there 's a bunch of stuff in there {comment} that 's missing from the dialogue . Mm - hmm . You know , it depends on the kind of research they 're doing , Yeah . but it might be , uh {pause} it might be really a {disfmarker} a pain . And , you know where it 's really gonna hurt somebody , in some way {disfmarker} the one who said it or someone who is being spoken about , {comment} we definitely want to allow the option of it being bleeped out . But I really think we wanna make it the rare incidence . And {disfmarker} and uh , I am just a little worried about making it so easy for people to do , and so much fun ! {vocalsound} that they 're gonna go through and bleep out stuff . So much fun . and they can bleep out stuff they don't like too , right from somebody else , as you say , you know , so \" well I didn't like what he said . \" Well I don't see any way of avoiding that . I mean , we have to provi we have promised that we would provide them the transcript and that they can remove parts that they don't like . So that the {disfmarker} Yeah . No , no , I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I don't {disfmarker} The only question is {disfmarker} You - you 've talked me into that , but I {disfmarker} I just think that we should make it harder to do . The problem is if it 's harder for them it 's also harder for me . Whereas this web interface , I just get email , it 's all formatted , it 's all ready to go and I can just insert it . So maybe you don't give them access to the web interface unless they really need it . So {disfmarker} so {disfmarker} so Well I guess {disfmarker} Yeah . I 'm sorry {disfmarker} so {disfmarker} so {disfmarker} So maybe this is a s a way out of it . Hmm . You 've provided something that 's useful for you to do {disfmarker} handle , and useful for someone else if they need it . But I think the issue of privacy and ease and so forth should be that uh , they get access to this if they really need it . Well {disfmarker} So you 're saying the {disfmarker} the sequence would be more like first Adam goes to the contact lists , contacts them via whatever their preferred method is , to see if they want to review the meeting . Right . And then if they don't , you 're done . If they do , then he provides them access to the {disfmarker} the web site . Well , to some extent I have to do that anyway because as I said we have to distribute passwords . W w Or {disfmarker} a printed - out form . There 's {disfmarker} there {disfmarker} So , y but you don't necessarily have to distribute passwords is what I 'm saying . Well , but {disfmarker} So {disfmarker} Only if they want it . what I 'm saying is that I can't just email them the password because that 's not secure . So they have to call me and ask . No , no , no . But you aren't necessarily giving them {disfmarker} Right . But {disfmarker} we don't even necessarily need to end up distributing passwords at all .  Well , we do because of privacy . We can't just make it openly available on the web . No , no . You 're missing the point . Mm - hmm . We 're {disfmarker} We 're trying i We 're trying to make it less of an obvious just l l l l uh fall off a log , to do this . Not everyone gets a password , unless they ask for it . Right ? So th so what I would see , is that first you contact them and ask them if they would like to review it for to check for the {disfmarker} Yeah . not just for fun , OK ? but to {disfmarker} to check this for uh things that they 're worried about having said or if they 're willing to just send an approval of it , at {disfmarker} from their memory . Um {disfmarker} and , uh , and we should think carefully actually we should review {disfmarker} go through how that 's worded , OK ? Then , if someone uh {disfmarker} wants to review it , uh , and I know you don't like this , but I 'm offering this as a suggestion , is that {disfmarker} is that we then give them a print out . And then if they say that \" I have a potential problem with these things , \" then , you {disfmarker} you say \" OK well you might wanna hear this in context to s think if you need that , \" you issue them a password , i in the {disfmarker} But the {disfmarker} the problem with what you 're suggesting is it 's not just inconvenient for them , it 's inconvenient for me . Because that means multiple contacts every time {disfmarker} for every single meeting every time anyone wants anything . I would much prefer to have all be automatic , they visit the web site if they want to . Obviously they don't have to . I know you 'd prefer it , but the proble Yeah . we have {disfmarker} So I think you 're thinking people are going to arbitrarily start bleeping and I just don't think that 's gonna happen . there 's a problem with it . I 'm also concerned about the spirit of the {disfmarker} of the informed consent thing . Cuz I think if they feel that uh , it 's {disfmarker} I th I th You know , if it turns out that something gets published in this corpus that someone really should have eliminated and didn't detect , then it could have been because of their own negligence that they didn't pursue that next level and get the password and do that , um , but {disfmarker} but they might be able to argue \" oh well it was cumbersome , and I was busy and it was gonna take me too much time to trace it down \" . So it could that the burden would come back onto us . So I 'm a little bit worried about uh , making it harder for them , from the legal standpoint . Well you can go too far in that direction , and you need to find somewhere between I think , Yeah . It seems to me that sending them email , saying \" if you have an O - OK reply to this email and say OK , because {disfmarker} Uh - huh . If you have a problem with it contact me and I 'll give you a password \" , seems like is a perfectly , reasonable compromise . And if they want a printout they can print it out themselves . Or we could print it up for them , Yeah . I mean we could offer that {disfmarker} but {disfmarker} but there 's uh , another aspect to that and that is that in the informed consent form , um , my impression is that they {disfmarker} that we offered them at the very least that they definitely would have access to the transcript . And {disfmarker} and I ha Yeah . I don't know that there 's a chance of really skipping that stage . I mean I {disfmarker} I thought that you were {disfmarker} Maybe I misinterpreted what you said but it 's {disfmarker} Having access to it doesn't necessarily mean , that {disfmarker} having it Having it . Giving it to them . Well the in {disfmarker} right ? It just means they have the right to have it . OK . the consent form is right in there if anyone wants to look at it , Alright . Fine . OK . Fair enough . so . Yeah . D you want me to grab one ? Sh - sh well I could {disfmarker} I 'm closer . Yeah , but you 're wired I could {disfmarker} aren't you ? Yeah . That is true . Um . {vocalsound} Yeah , I mean I don't wanna fool them , I don't know {disfmarker} I just meant that e every {disfmarker} ev any time you say anything to anyone there is in fact a {disfmarker} a bias that is presented , Oh yeah yeah {disfmarker} oh I know . right ? \" If you agree to participate you 'll have the opportunity to have anything ex anything excised , which you would prefer not to have included in the data set . \" of {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} Yeah that 's true . Yeah . \" Once a transcript is available we will ask your permission to include the data in the corpus for the r larger research community . Yeah . There again you will be allowed to indicate any sections that you 'd prefer to have excised from the database , and they will m be removed both from the transcript and the recording . \" Hmm . Well that 's more open than I realized . Well , I mean it {disfmarker} The one question is definitely clear with anything as opposed to just what you said . I {disfmarker} Yeah . Yeah , uh no that {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} tha Tha - that 's true . That 's more severe , but the next one says the transcript will be around . that 's right . And it doesn't {comment} really say we 'll send it to you , or wi it 'll be available for you on the web , or anything . I think it probably leaves it open how we get it to them . I I {disfmarker} At least it more often . Yeah . It means also we don't have to g To give it to them . I mean like {disfmarker} like Morgan was saying they {disfmarker} they {disfmarker} They just have to make sure that it is available to them . It 's available to them if they ask for it . Yeah , OK , so . wh um {disfmarker} I think I have an idea that may be sat may satisfy both you and me in this which is , um , it 's a {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} we just go over carefully how these notes to people are worded . So I {disfmarker} I just want it to be worded in such a way where it gives the strong impre it gives very , I mean nothing hidden , v very strongly the bias that we would really like to use all of these data . Right . That {disfmarker} that we really would rather it wasn't a patchwork of things tossed out , Good . that it would be better for , um , our , uh , field if that is the case . But if you really think something is gonna {disfmarker} And I don't think there 's anything in the legal aspects that {disfmarker} that is hurt by our expressing that bias . Great . Great , great . And then {disfmarker} then my concern about {disfmarker} which {disfmarker} Yeah . I agree . you know you might be right , it may be it was just paranoia on my part , uh but people just {disfmarker} See I 'm @ @ worried about this interface so much fun {vocalsound} that people start bleeping stuff out {comment} {vocalsound} just as {disfmarker} just because they can . It 's just a check box next to the text , it 's not any fun at all . Yeah . Well I don't know . I kind of had fun when you played me something that was bleeped out . You know . Well , but they won't get that feedback . I All {disfmarker} no because it doesn't automatically bleep it at the time . Oh they won't ? It just sends me {disfmarker} Oh good . So you haven't made it so much fun . Right . Oh good . It just sends me the time intervals . OK , And then at some point I 'll incorporate them all and put bleeps . I mean I don't wanna have t ha do that yet until we actually release the data Yeah . because um , then we have to have two copies of every meeting and we 're already short on disk space . Yeah . So I {disfmarker} I wanna {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} just keep the times until we actually wanna release the data and then we bleep it . OK . Alright , so I think {disfmarker} Yeah so if we have if {disfmarker} i Again let 's you know , sort of circulate the {disfmarker} the wording on each of these things and get it right , Well since you seem to feel heart uh , strongest about it , would you like to do the first pass ? but {disfmarker} but {disfmarker} OK . Uh , fair enough . Turn about is fair play , Al - Also it ther there is this other question , the legal question that {disfmarker} that Adam 's raised , uh about whether we need a concrete signature , or email c i suffices or whatever Sorry . Yeah . and I don't know how that works . i There 's something down there about \" if you agree to {disfmarker} \" I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm {disfmarker} I thought {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I thought about it with one of my background processes I don't think so . and I {disfmarker} uh it 's {disfmarker} uh it 's uh , it 's fine to do the email . Ah . Fine . Yeah because thi th they 're signing here that they 're agreeing to the paragraph which says \" you 'll be given an opportunity . \" OK . Good . OK . Yeah . And so I don't think they need another signature . And {disfmarker} Well and furthermore I {disfmarker} it 's now fairly routine in a lot of arrangements that I do with people on contracts and so forth that {disfmarker} that uh if it 's {disfmarker} if it 's that sort of thing where you 're you 're saying uh \" OK I agree , we want eighty hours of this person at such - and - such amount , and I agree that 's OK , \" uh if it 's a follow up to some other agreement where there was a signature it 's often done in email now Right . so it 's {disfmarker} it 's OK . Great . Um . So I guess I probably should at the minimum , think about how to present it in a printed form . I 'm not really sure what 's best with that . The problem is a lot of them are really short , Well {disfmarker} and so I don't necessarily wanna do one per line . But I don't know how else to do it . Well I s I also have this {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I think it 's nice you have it uh , viewab her {comment} hearable on the {disfmarker} on the web for those who might wonder about um , the non nonverbal side , I mean I {disfmarker} I agree that our bias should be as {disfmarker} as expressed here , and {disfmarker} but I {disfmarker} I think it 's nice that a person could check . Cuz sometimes you know you {disfmarker} the words on a {disfmarker} on the page , come out soun sounding different in terms of the {pause} social dynamics if they hear it . Hmm . Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . And I realize we shouldn't emphasize that people {comment} you know , shouldn't borrow trouble . What it comes down to but {disfmarker} Yeah I think actually {disfmarker} my opinion probably is that the only time someone will need to listen to it is if the transcript is uh not good . You know , if {disfmarker} if there are lots of mumbles and parentheses and things like that . Oh , you know , or what if there was an error in the transcript that didn't get detected and there was a whole uh {disfmarker} i segment a against some {disfmarker} {vocalsound} personal {vocalsound} i th Right . That was all mumbled ? Yeah . I think Microsoft is Yeah exactly Oh , Sorry transcribers . Or {disfmarker} or even {disfmarker} {vocalsound} or even {comment} there was a {disfmarker} a line you know about how \" hmm - mmm - mmm {comment} Bill Gates duh - duh - duh - duh . \" Yeah . but {disfmarker} but it was all {disfmarker} the words were all visible , but they didn't end up i some there was a slip in the transcript . Oh , God . They 're gonna hate this meeting . Yeah . Yeah that 's true . Actually Liz will like it . You know , but . Liz will like it . We had a pretty strong disagreement going there . Yep , yep , that 's right . Yeah . Yeah . So I don't know . I mean , I {disfmarker} I guess we 're assuming that the transcript is a close enough approximation and that {disfmarker} that my double checking will be {pause} so close to absolutely perfect that it {disfmarker} that nothing will slip by . Mm - hmm . But it {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} some something might sometime , and they {disfmarker} uh {disfmarker} if {disfmarker} if it 's something that they said , they might {disfmarker} i i I mean , you might be very accurate in putting down what they actually said , Mm - hmm . but , when they hear it , themselves , they may hear something different because they know what they meant . I don't know how to notate that . Sarcasm , Yeah , that 's right . how do you {disfmarker} how do you indicate sarcasm ? Yeah that 's right . No , I 'm serious . So {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} so {disfmarker} i the {disfmarker} so we might {disfmarker} we might get some feedback from people that such - and - such was , you know , not {disfmarker} not really what I said . Yeah . Well that would be good to get , definitely . Yeah , but , Yeah , sure . Just for corrections . Yeah . So um , in terms of password distribution , I think phone is really the only way to do it , phone and in person . Or mail , physical mail . Yeah . Or if for leave it on their voice mail . Any sub - word level thing .  Any sub - wor Yeah , OK . I mean you could do it with PGP or things like that but it 's too complex . You know I just realized something , which is of {disfmarker} e th this question about the {disfmarker} uh the possible mismatch of {disfmarker} I mean i well , and actually also the lawyer saying that um , we shouldn't really have them {disfmarker} have the people believing that they will be cleared by our checks . You know ? Mm - hmm . I mean . So it 's like i in a way it 's {disfmarker} it 's nice to have the responsibility still on them to listen to the tape and {disfmarker} and hear the transcript , to have that be the {disfmarker} Well yeah , but you can't dep I mean , most people will not wanna take the time to do that , though . Yeah , OK , fair enough . And they 're s they 're absorbing the responsibility themselves . And they {disfmarker} they have to {disfmarker} So it 's not {disfmarker} it 's not um {disfmarker} Yeah , good . But I mean if you were at a meeting , and {disfmarker} and you {disfmarker} you don't think , at least , that you said anything funny and the meeting was about , you know , some {disfmarker} some funny thing about semantics or something , or uh {disfmarker} You probably won't listen to it . Yeah . It is true that tec that the content is technical , I {disfmarker} and so i and we 're not having these discussions which {disfmarker} Yeah . I {disfmarker} I mean , when I listen to these things , I don't find things that are questionable , in other people 's speech or in my own . Yeah . You would think it would be rare , Just {disfmarker} It should be very rare . I mean we 're not talking about the energy crisis or something , people have {disfmarker} Yeah . Yeah , OK . How about them energy crises . Yeah . I think we 're uh {disfmarker} Done ? Kind of done . Actually , I was gonna {disfmarker} Di - Did you have anything n that 's going on , or {disfmarker} Not really . No . Um , {vocalsound} my project is going along but um , I 'm really just here to um fill the project uh {disfmarker} the overall progress . I don't really have anything specific to {disfmarker} to talk about . Yeah . That 's fine . I just didn't wanna go by you , if you had something . Oh , OK . You don't have anything to say . No . Nah .   Transcribers , he was rattling the b marbles in his brain back and forth just then this {disfmarker} this {disfmarker} Shall we do digits ? Oh yeah . Um , oh by the way I did find a bunch {disfmarker} It um Uh , we should count out how many more digits to forms do we have back there ? There were quite a few . Uh . That 's what I thought . I f I was going through them all and I found actually a lot filed in with them , that were blanks , that no one had actually read . Mmm . And so we still have more than I thought we did . Oh good . So , we have a few more digits before we 're done . You know having this headset reminds me of like working at Burger King or something . Oops . Oh , did you do that ?

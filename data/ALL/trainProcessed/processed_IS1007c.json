        "transcript": "So we come to the third meetings . I have {gap} good . {vocalsound} Um so in the last meeting we have discussed the functional design and now we will talk about the conceptual design . So we will talk about some specific details . Okay so I think I will do my presentation on the components concept so can you please uh open uh {disfmarker} I'm participant two . This {disfmarker} Components design . {gap} Okay so uh the first thing uh I have done is to to made a review together with the uh manufactural uh department and have which components was uh available to build a remote control . So for energy sources we have we have to choose between the solar energy , hand dynamo and uh kinetic um well uh kinetic uh technique {vocalsound} to to store the energy . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} We also um {vocalsound} we also can put a regular battery in the in the remote control . Now {disfmarker} Uh this is what we have decided in the last meeting . But if we use battery {disfmarker} Yeah b uh f well uh I meant uh by by battery I meant uh I will not have a uh a wire between the remote control and the energy source but uh I didn't fou we didn't decide yet which kind of battery we will put inside the the remote . So uh it's a point to discuss . Then uh the case material we have uh uh also several choices , like wood , rubber , titanium or latex . {vocalsound} But uh well it's not a a re uh well a real issue for the {vocalsound} {disfmarker} from the technical uh point of view . Concerning the interface uh we can we can put mm just simple buttons or scrolls or buttons uh much more complicated , but it also requires that the chip to process the button is more complicated so . Mm . {vocalsound} And uh this is the last point , the choice of chips . So what I have f found is that I think basic battery or kinetic uh energy uh collection is the is the better way to provide energy because I think solar energy wi won't work {vocalsound} in a cluttered uh {vocalsound} uh environment . Mm . So um so I think we can start with these two main things . For the case uh well uh I think that uh titanium is um is a good choice because it's trendy and it's uh it's uh well it's modern and uh user are are are {disfmarker} mm will be uh very happy to have a {vocalsound} a a nice remote . For the interface uh I think that we can ach achieve uh all the desired functionalities by s just uh using uh rubber buttons , simple buttons and th thus this allow to use a regular chip {vocalsound} that are uh well cheaper . {vocalsound} Mm . And s so uh we can move to the next slide . Sorry . Yeah . What is this single curved {disfmarker} what does it mean ? Well uh uh i i it's uh it's the the shape of the um of the remote . So it's it's not {disfmarker} You you will have the {disfmarker} well um the the curve will fit into your hand when you grab the {disfmarker} Yo l yeah . When you hold on it , it is comfortable to hold . Yeah . It's more confog f comfortable that if these uh it's completely flat . Okay . Yeah . And the battery , is it kind of a rechargeable or it doesn't matter ? Yeah the um that's the point . The kinetic one is uh y you can recharge uh by the um {disfmarker} That that's what it means by kinetic . {vocalsound} Yeah and by {disfmarker} well by just by moving the ar uh your arm the mm well the remote will uh accumulate energy . Okay . Mm-hmm . Okay . But I d I don't know it's {disfmarker} if it is feasible because I don't know if yet if if the user will move enough to provide the remote um all the necessary energy . Mm . {vocalsound} Mm . Okay . Yeah . Yeah . We we might check with our R_ and D_ department to see if they have this product {vocalsound} ready for market . {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} And {disfmarker} yeah and so can you go to the next slide please . So and uh that's uh that summarize well what I have said . Mm mm . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Wha So uh you're right we can uh see in our uh R_ and D_ uh {vocalsound} if the kinetic metal is sufficient to provide enough energy . Ah the department . Mm . {vocalsound} That's it . Uh {disfmarker} So I um keep in touch with the R_ and D_ department . Oh yeah {vocalsound} I take care , it's all right . {vocalsound} So the titanium case is the normal case that {disfmarker} I'll show you some pictures that I have and you tell me whether they are titanium case or not . {vocalsound} All right . Yeah . 'Cause I am not very sure , plastic , titanium or whatever . There's another point I want to make , is that the uh {disfmarker} well you've seen them I le na my presentation that um I point out some {disfmarker} why buttons are not the mm not the only ways you can {vocalsound} use {disfmarker} Yeah . Yeah , maybe n {vocalsound} We will , okay . {vocalsound} Three . Yeah . {vocalsound} So the user interface is uh i it uses the aspect uh of a computer system , a programme which can be seen or heard or otherwise perceived by the human user {gap} and the commands and mechanism the user uses to control its operation and input data . So you s this gives you the ways to input data and we have uh {disfmarker} we are more {disfmarker} we emphasise more on the graphical user interface here . The idea is to represent buttons as figures , diagrams , symbols and on so you you can easily when you look at the symbols you understand what it is doing . What's the function of this button . Yeah . Yeah . So . I think it makes the the interface really {disfmarker} Ea easy to use . So next one . Graphical user interface {gap} . {gap} function five . So I can use the button , the mouse maybe . A graphical user interface emphasise the use of pictures . Yeah . So next line . So the {disfmarker} here are some examples . So they cluster the buttons together . They group them into col they colour them and uh they have different forms as well . Mm but this interface are kind of confusing . Uh basically there are too many buttons . Right . Next one . Yeah . So some people are propose voice recognition and so {disfmarker} ah by the way I receive an email from the from one our departments saying that the voice recognition has been used in the coffee machine {vocalsound} for this by a company {vocalsound} when you tell the {disfmarker} you say good morning coffee machine and the machine are reply to you . So I just got an email saying that . Mm-hmm mm mm . And it seems like this voice recognition technology is ready to be used so we might consider that , supposedly . Yeah fine . {vocalsound} The next one . Mm so somebody {disfmarker} some people use uh some people use a spinning wheel th with the L_C_ display so instead of using the mm buttons you have a L_C_D_ screen and then there you can u you can use that as buttons , you can use that as real {disfmarker} so so that could be an option as well . Touch screen , I mean . Yeah . Next one . And some people propose a scroll button . Integrated with push buttons or you may have scroll button instead of p just the push button . Like the one we have here . Uh , next one . So mm Mm-hmm . so there are a few aspects that I collected here . So s basically this deals with special users , children , handicapped people , old people , and uh mm and prog basically they are programmable , specially for children . And uh mm {disfmarker} yeah yeah . And then they also secure uh covers , to protect uh secure and hidden programming and battery covers that will protect your settings . So {disfmarker} But we don't have to integrate all these complicated features . I'm just saying that the {disfmarker} currently in the market there are there are control there are remote controllers f {gap} customisable for different people . Yeah , so that's the point . The next one . And uh you see this is the one where you have the protection cover . Mm maybe useful for children , they migh you you they only see the buttons outside . And for adults wh where you have more control you can see the one inside . So the adults might wanna have a key to lock that to pr so children will not touch the button inside . Yeah . Yeah . S a good idea . The next one . {vocalsound} So this guy {disfmarker} this is another company that provides big buttons . At {disfmarker} I see that that is useful for old people and then you don't get it lost . But for our product we don't need a big one because you have voice recognition e eventually with use . Yeah . And you can call your remote controller if you don't know where it is . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} T_V_ remote controller where are you ? {vocalsound} And then , he will beeps and to say that I am here , {vocalsound} for example . {vocalsound} {gap} We should include speech synthesis in this case , no ? Is it possible ? Yeah . Yeah . Uh ? {vocalsound} Yeah but uh as Norman say if uh there is uh already a commercial product available who t who do this we we can check uh to integrate it i into our uh new remote control . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . And uh , this is another one where you can uh {disfmarker} the the the part that's a V_ standing for the volume . So there's a up arrow and a down arrow . But you the see that in the V_ , the V_ appears to be the down arrow on the top {disfmarker} on the top up arrow {disfmarker} {vocalsound} if you {disfmarker} Mm-hmm . up arrow there's a V_ like as as if it's turning down so it's confusing interface , so I wanna avoid this kind of thing in the design . Yeah yeah . And here are {disfmarker} is uh here is a s short summary that I summary that I compiled after the findings I found . Big buttons are convenient , voice recognition helps , push buttons , scroll buttons , spinning wheels can be used as navigation tools . And uh user customisable is important and finally simplicity simplicity is the key . Yeah . So {vocalsound} we have many concepts there Hmm . {vocalsound} but we have to choose later on which ones are important to be used . Yeah . And basically uh {disfmarker} Well I {vocalsound} I think you it's it's it's fine you have uh reviewed all all the possibilities Yeah . but uh uh well uh i if we consider that uh the user interface is displayed on the T_V_ screen I don't think we nee uh we need much buttons in the remote {gap} Mm-hmm . since we we just have to navigate and to have a okay or enter key or things like that , Yeah . Mm . because uh adding wheels or scrolls uh makes the thing more complicated and more expensive also , so . Mm . Okay . Or maybe we can include the user manual in the in the remote control {gap} and we should have just a button like help and you say uh and you ik you press the button help and maybe you see the the user m might in the in the T_V_ . Yeah . That's a good idea . {vocalsound} To have a help button . A help button . Yeah . So you are display on the screen . Yeah . On T_V_ T_V_ screen . So {disfmarker} on the T_V_ screen . On the T_V_ screen . On the T_V_ screen the uh how to use your remote . So just you push the button Okay . Okay . Okay . and we will {disfmarker} Oh . So that eliminates all the complicated documentation {gap} , Yeah . okay . So wi But people are often enough looking at the help , If the if {disfmarker} once they see the help button they say oh this is a complicated stuff . {vocalsound} No {vocalsound} In the case where they need help , in the case where they need help . Uh yeah . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} It's a psychology . {vocalsound} In a marketing point of view . {vocalsound} Okay . Yeah . And let us see what the market demands . Yeah . We could just go to my presentation . But {disfmarker} uh wel well I think {disfmarker} It's just for user customizable , for kids or old people . Yeah that's right . Mm . So {disfmarker} I mean it just showed us the remote with an cap which could be used for kids and if you remove the {disfmarker} So it's the same {disfmarker} Same remote with some {disfmarker} Can be used by both kids and old people . Both yeah . Mm . {vocalsound} Well uh what I s propose is that uh you know a remote controller , i {vocalsound} it could be a cube , {vocalsound} is uh a small device that uh looks like a cube and maybe you can just change the {vocalsound} um the buttons , if you ch turn one side you get one one buttons , you turn the other side you get the other buttons , so for maybe new generation people who get used to the computer they want lots of controls . {vocalsound} Maybe for kids , kids they like uh t no l they like to {disfmarker} Small {disfmarker} Uh well . Yeah . So le le let's see what uh what {vocalsound} people want . Let's see the market demand . {vocalsound} And then we can decide what what we can {disfmarker} yeah . What what {gap} market {disfmarker} yes yes . {gap} So we just made an marketing survey of what people need from our remotes and how it could be special from the other remotes . And we got the best on the responses from the questionnaires . Uh we also have some prizes for the most creative solutions . And we found the following solutions which we could {disfmarker} which would be helpful for our design . So seventy percent of the users , they find their remote controls very ugly , they don't find it pleasant to use in the size or usage or anything . And eighty percent of the people they are always l I mean they are willing to spend more money if the remote control would look fancy . And the current remote controls do not match well the operating behaviour of the user . And seventy five percent of the users said they zap a lot . Yeah . {vocalsound} And fifty percent say they use only ten percent of the buttons , Mm-hmm . Yeah . so the rest of the ninety percent of the buttons they're not used most of the times . Yeah . Yes . So this were the findings which we found . And also they cited frustrations with the present remote controls . Most of {disfmarker} fifty percent of the time the remote controls are lost somewhere in the room and people are always searching for them {vocalsound} rather than watching the T_V_ . Yeah . And by the time they found the remote control the program is finished . Yeah . So {vocalsound} they're frustrated a lot {vocalsound} {vocalsound} And um if the remote control is too complicated it takes much time to learn the functionality of it . Mm . Mm , the functionalities yeah . So you can just see the percentage , fifty percent people they responded that they always lose their remotes and thirty four percent they say that it's quite difficult to learn if it's too complex . {vocalsound} Yeah . So keeping in view all these findings and the frustrations I think this should be the solution for them . We should have an L_C_D_ on the rem remote control . Oh . Well mm w well I I I don't really see the advantage of having uh L_C_D_ on the on the remote control if we have a a a big screen and uh display on the screen . Big screen . It's {disfmarker} Mm-hmm ? yeah of course it's fancy trendy and so on but it's it's expensive to produce {vocalsound} and it's not really {disfmarker} I mean as our survey says that people are willing to pay more if their remotes are fancy . Yeah . So if we have a L_C_D_ on the remote , rather than looking onto the T_V_ you just look into a remote and navigate it . It's the same menu as we have saw that iPod remote control . Mm yeah . {vocalsound} Yeah yeah . Mm . The thing {vocalsound} {disfmarker} We just {vocalsound} play around Yeah but when you play with the iPod you don't have {vocalsound} a big screen in front of you , s You can use this screen instead of the big se screen , Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . instead of use the {disfmarker} yeah . If you re-use the existing screen , we element {disfmarker} eliminate the L_C_D_ , after all the L_C_D_ just to display Hmm . and if you have the colourful screen you can make the display colourful , fancy , as fancy as the one on the L_C_D_ , Yeah . maybe even better . Yeah . So {disfmarker} I mean this were the points which we got from the market demands . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah yeah . Yeah . So So I th I I {vocalsound} well I think we we can focus on the uh on the fancy look on the uh Yeah . More on a fancy design . {vocalsound} Yeah that's fine . on the speech recognition if the technology is available Yeah . I mean that's {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Yeah . but well I think L_C_D_ will uh will uh make us spend a lot of money for not so big results . Mm . Remember we have a s budget for the cost of producing the remote controller . Mm-hmm . But {disfmarker} Yeah . Yeah . So i is {disfmarker} Uh yeah we have uh {disfmarker} {gap} so the thing is you can find out how much an L_C_D_ will cost and then we'll decide again . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} I mean that should be found out by the Industrial Designers . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Uh maybe you can find out the price and tell us next time {gap} . Is i if i So price of uh L_C_D_ display . Yeah . And {disfmarker} And it's always good to have an voice recognition for the remote controls . Yeah . And also the cost for the speech recognition . Mm . It's for {disfmarker} Ask our R_ and D_ department . Yeah . it's just for small vocabulary . We {disfmarker} it's not {disfmarker} Yeah . Yeah it's o only for a limited vocabulary , yeah . Yeah . And ho say eighty commands or so . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah okay . And also the scroller button , how much will it cost . {vocalsound} And {disfmarker} Well uh compared to the to s the simpl simpler simplest button . {vocalsound} Yeah . Push push {gap} . Mm , the scroll button , {gap} from the survey we never see that people would like to have some scrolling button . Yeah . Yeah I think that {disfmarker} Because they they just they're just frightened to use the scrollings or {vocalsound} help button . Yeah . Yeah I I I think that uh well uh as we have seen in the in the presentation uh well uh about uh uh fifty percent of the of the percent n choose the button Don't use the buttons . so uh I think to have uh five uh simple button is sufficient for our functionality . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . It doesn't mean that the other buttons are not necessary or important . Yeah . {vocalsound} Important . Yeah . But {disfmarker} But they are just less used compar They're not used much . yeah . But the uh the thing is is i is that we can add a functionality on the on the T_V_ screen Yeah . like uh a a list of function Yeah . Mm . and then you choose with the with the button to {disfmarker} well you navigate Yeah , yeah . So so the at most {disfmarker} more power uh . and you {disfmarker} Or maybe we can u uh or maybe we can uh make this the ten percent of button more bigger than the others . Yeah . So . {vocalsound} But if i i if we if we could have a a a display uh g a user interface that is very complete on the T_V_ screen {vocalsound} I think that just five buttons are sufficient , Yep . one to go up left right down and uh enter Yeah . and you you you just select the functionality you want to access or things like that . Mm . Mm . Yeah . You don't have to to switch to a channel to another uh {disfmarker} Mm . Yeah . Or it could be like this , as the people say , if they have a L_C_D_ on the remote not on the television . Because when you have the L_C_D_ onto the television screen you miss the picture in the background , we are most focused on the commands . Yeah but {disfmarker} So if you have then L_C_D_ in the remote , you just have a menu , and increasing and lower these signs here to change the programs and this menu when you press the menu , in the L_C_D_ displays as you go on pressing the menu it faster displays volume , then the program , then the brightness , contrast and all the stuff . Mm . {vocalsound} {gap} Yeah but if you look at the L_C_D_ you you don't look at the T_V_ screen And accordingly you can just increase or decrease . It's {disfmarker} Mm . Mm . so {vocalsound} i i it's not really worth to get {disfmarker} to have the image if you don't look at , so . I if {disfmarker} Mm . Mm . And I think it's increases the cost of the the remote control if you use L_C_D_ . I {disfmarker} Yeah . Yeah . Yeah that has to be checked out . I think that there's no contradiction here , because if there are few buttons , you don't have to look at your your controller any more because you know where the buttons are , so if you wanna control the screen d sh sharpness you just say sharpness Yeah . and then you t turn {disfmarker} you just press lef increase or decrease button {vocalsound} and the same for the volume and the channel , {vocalsound} Yeah . if you had the speech recognition there you just shout your channel , just tell your channel and then you don't even have to look at the butto at the controller so finally that wil eliminates the the need for L_C_D_ , Okay . with the help of speech recogniser you can {disfmarker} I mean , {gap} better if we could just check all the cost with L_C_D_ Yeah . and also with the speech recognition . Mm . Yeah . And then we could find which would would be a more suitable in this case . Mm . Mm . {vocalsound} Yeah . A and {disfmarker} And the third problem was to find the remote control . Always , so fifty percent of the people say they lose the remotes . Well so we we can think about a well a a vocal command like uh find Mm . and {vocalsound} when the remote control uh hears fine well yeah just uh to make him beep or t You will listen to a peep , {vocalsound} special peep . Where {gap} , yeah . {vocalsound} Yeah that's right , that's exactly what I mean by voice commander . Yeah . Or it could be also something like this , Yeah . uh it's always boring to change the batteries of the remotes control , Mm . Yeah . so we have some one charger there and whenever we don't use the remote control we put it in the charger . Put it back at the charge . Put {disfmarker} Yeah . And when we're using that t remote and if we misplace somewhere , in the charger we have a small button , and just by pressing the button in the charger the uh remote control beeps , wherever it is . Okay . Yeah . Yeah . And that's a good idea , that's simple , like in phones . Yeah . Mm . I mean it doe it also doesn't require a voice command , But you don't you don't have to move the the charger . Yeah . because there are problems with a voice command . Hmm . Mm . {vocalsound} Th yeah . Mm yeah . Yeah . Mm . Yeah , yeah , yeah . You have to keep it {gap} . I mean charger would be fixed Yeah . because it's always with electricity plugged . Yeah if there if there uh there is nuff not enough battery . Also and uh uh the remote is lost . Okay . Mm . There's {disfmarker} mm . Mm . {vocalsound} Yeah . Yeah that's right . That {disfmarker} we can {disfmarker} what we can do is we can program a function whereby when you press the switch off T_V_ button , the off button , the remote there be s uh instruction on the screen , please charge charge me . You never get it lost Yeah . because uh every time you're off the computer {vocalsound} {disfmarker} the T_V_ you are asked the the command the T_V_ com remote controller would tell you to put it back to where {disfmarker} to the charger . It's an good reminder , Yeah . So you will never get lost {gap} {disfmarker} yeah . yeah that's right . Okay . Maybe for some people {gap} {vocalsound} lazy people . Yeah . Yeah because everything is programmed inside . Yeah yeah . So it's it's uh it's all about strategy , y And of course the final point is a fancy look . Mm . As we have seen earlier the remotes which were displayed by Norman they weren't fancy , Mm . They were ugly . {vocalsound} Yeah , yeah . I mean mm very big or something with lot of buttons . {vocalsound} They {disfmarker} Mm . I think we should have something {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} Well the last one with the um {vocalsound} yeah with the two parts was uh {gap} original , so {disfmarker} With uh two two two parts controller . I mean {gap} uh I mean uh I mean uh you see if it's like that even a kid who wants to have a control he could just plug it and {vocalsound} use it , you can't avoid him . {vocalsound} Yeah . But you can have an button for child lock . Yeah . Yeah . Mm . So just by pressing the button with some code , you t you put a lock onto the remote , so that he can't use even {gap} {disfmarker} Mm . Mm . Mm . Mm . Well we can think about uh having uh on the on the on the user interface when you switch on the T_V_ you can uh well write a code or choose a category , if it is kids , uh things like that . Mm uh {disfmarker} Mm . Or {disfmarker} Mm . Yeah . Mm . That's right . Or maybe you have to to show some specific programmes for kids and then just just {disfmarker} yeah just push uh kids button so it's automatically Mm . {gap} these are probl yeah . Mm . Mm . Mm . {gap} . So if he {gap} . I think these other four points they're the market demands and so it's for the user interface design and industrial design to just think {disfmarker} So for mm {disfmarker} Yeah . Mm . yeah . So for my part I will check the prices the um the prices difference uh of what to use , where to use , and s uh and so on . Yeah I think it should be clearer for us in the next meeting that th uh these {gap} could be included . Yeah . Mm . {vocalsound} I think we need to define also a s the set of vocabularies for the speech recogniser Yeah . because uh if you want {gap} uh say we can sort by channels or sort by T_V_ programs , you have to decide a category of vocabularies for them . If numbers , they're easy , Mm-hmm . but if {gap} name the channel by by name {disfmarker} Well I think we can we can have just numbers for channels and you can say to your remote control like uh sports and then on the T_V_ you have a list with with uh uh well with sports program playing now Mm . and and uh {disfmarker} No , we have a problem there . You see uh if you have a voice commands and you are s you are watching a score on uh {disfmarker} basketball score or something , and if the score comes twenty four thirty five , you've just say twenty five Yeah it's {disfmarker} yeah . and suddenly {vocalsound} the screen the channel goes to twenty five . Mm . That's right , yeah , yeah . So I think there should be a prefix to some numbers {disfmarker} Well but well e every possible word uh has a probability to come about of the T_V_ so . {vocalsound} Yeah . I mean the the {disfmarker} you just check all the probability that saying T_V_ twenty five and just ordinary twenty five . Mm . Yeah yeah . Ordinary twenty five you almost there's a probability of being said around sixty seventy percent Mm . Yeah but well {disfmarker} okay . and T_V_ twenty five I dunno it will be round about one or two percent . Mm . Mm-hmm . Mm . So it's better to have some prefix {gap} before the number . But I I I think that the user would like wou would like to associate the channel or call the channel rather than than the numbers . Yeah something , some code . You say numbe channel number five of the T_V_ correspond to something else in the channel . Yeah yeah . So some people may want to say , I want to see this channel . Mm mm . Well I {disfmarker} That will be too big . Or just {disfmarker} And it will be difficult for the vocabulary also . Yeah . Check with the v R_ and D_ department the capability of recogniser . It's difficult to to just say the the name of the channel . It will be difficult to say just the name of the channel . {vocalsound} Uh ? Because you have to s t uh a ch Well , it's convenient for the user . yeah but you have to to have all the name of the channel in your vocabulary . Als might be you just forgot the channel name , you kno only know the number . Or maybe {disfmarker} Yeah . Then {disfmarker} Or maybe the user can create his own vocabulary , The {disfmarker} uh uh mm . {vocalsound} Mm . just pronouncing the the name of channels and include in the vocabulary . I I think that I have {disfmarker} mm mm {vocalsound} I think there's another way you can do is that uh you can uh {vocalsound} if {disfmarker} when the user ch press a button to choose the channel for example , then what you can do is that the {disfmarker} you can make the T_V_ screen to split them into small little little squares of images where you you you have a snapshot of every channel , so let's say it's a four by four matrix of the images , so now what you do is f looking at the all the sixteen channels available at one time , you just use the control button uh , you just you you just choose the the option you want Yeah , the {gap} . and then you just hit the button and then you go to that channel . So {disfmarker} Or lets the user create his own vocabulary of channel . Mm . So you you don't use the speech recogniser in that way . No . Just you have uh in the beginning you have uh t you have to train {disfmarker} you have to create the vocabulary by yourself . Oh , okay . Yeah . Well I uh I also {disfmarker} By associating each channel with the name or {disfmarker} I I also think about uh another problem , if if there is uh more than one person who is watching T_V_ {vocalsound} And for each one has his own . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} the s well the the speech uh r recogniser should be able to distinguish between the two . Yeah yeah , {gap} . Because uh I remember when I was a {vocalsound} young child with my sister we {disfmarker} yeah we always want to w to watch different emission at the at the same time Mm . Or you have to s {vocalsound} Yeah , I wanna watch this , I wanna watch that . Yeah . so it's a pr it could be a problem if uh if well if someone passes by when you are watching T_V_ and say oh T_V_ thirty {vocalsound} and just run , s Mm . A and in the same lines we would have a {disfmarker} one more problem . If we are using the television in the different environments , say in the factories or in the shops where there is a lot of noise and this voice commands if they fail to work , that would bring a bad name {disfmarker} bad uh reputation for our company . Yeah , yeah . Yeah . Mm . Mm . So I think we should specify some pre-requirements if we want to use a voice commands , say that it should be used in an silent homely environment or s something . {vocalsound} Yeah . Or we can switch on or switch off the the special {gap} , yeah . Yeah that's right that should be an option . Mm . Yeah that's {disfmarker} well I think that's a good uh a good option because it's simple and uh simple to implement also , so . Hmm . I think these are the practical problems .

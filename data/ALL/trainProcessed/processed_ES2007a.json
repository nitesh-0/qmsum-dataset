        "transcript": "Mm-hmm ? Okay . Ooh . {gap} So we're 'kay ? On the {gap} or {disfmarker} No . I dunno where to put it 'cause the {disfmarker} Okay . Could you s take it off ? {gap} . Is that alright ? {vocalsound} {gap} or {disfmarker} Okay . Okay . Keeps coming off . 'S fiddly . Hmm . {gap} {vocalsound} Right . How do we sta wa how do we start ? Does anybody know ? Oh , another one . So that's this {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Oh okay , right . Are we free to take notes uh {disfmarker} Okay . Uh {vocalsound} {gap} . {vocalsound} {gap} . Hmm . Okay , just hang on a second everybody . I haven't actually looked at this yet . {vocalsound} Ah . {gap} um {disfmarker} Very nice . I haven't looked at it , but let's just start it off and we'll see what happens . If you're all ready . Yeah . So {gap} is the agenda ? Opening , acquaintance , tool training and project plan , discussion and then closing . Project aim is a new remote control . It's original , uh trendy and it's user-friendly . 'Kay . Project method , functional design , individual work , another meeting , conceptual design , individual work , and a meeting of details design , individual work and a meeting . Tool training . Try out the whiteboard , every participant should draw their favourite animal and sum up their favourite characteristics of that animal . Okay . Um . Uh Miss Industrial Designer , would you like to go first ? Okay . So are we supposed to bring the little things for the {disfmarker} Yeah , why don't you just c , I think just clip on {disfmarker} clip {vocalsound} {disfmarker} do you have a belt ? Mm . Clip {gap} . Or put 'em in your pocket , yeah . Yeah . {vocalsound} {gap} okay . So my favourite animal {disfmarker} Yeah , what's your favourite animal ? 'Kay um {disfmarker} Ah . Is it rude ? It's an elephant . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} That's a very good elephant . The back end of an elephant . Oh my gosh , I'm never gonna be able to draw that well . {vocalsound} 'Kay , and you want to write up on there , it says you've gotta sum up your f f your favourite characteristics of that animal . Um {vocalsound} okay , it's big , it's got a great memory . Does it ? Oh . Supposed to have a great memory , we say an elephant never forgets . Mm . Mm . And uh dunno know why but {vocalsound} looks like nice to me . Okay . Wonderful , well done . Nice animal . Do you want to use the wipe {disfmarker} the m the wiper and wipe it off ? Okay . And Mister aesthetics designer do you wanna go next ? {vocalsound} Aesthetic yep , sure . I have no idea what my favourite animal is . 'Kay , my favourite animal , {vocalsound} uh let's see . Oh . Dunno if any of you have seen Napoleon Dynamite before . It's {disfmarker} It's a liger {vocalsound} , No . A what ? a combination of a lion and tiger {vocalsound} . Alright . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Have you not seen Napoleon Dynamite ? How {gap} . No . No . Oh it's a hilarious movie . No . You have to see it . And and it's best characteristic is it's pretty much the awesomest animal . But you have to see the movie to fully appreciate it . {vocalsound} Okay , well done . Great . Me ? Yeah . Miss mar Miss Marketing ? Okay . Not quite sure how this is gonna work . There {gap} go . {vocalsound} Cool . {vocalsound} Uh {vocalsound} well I'll try my best {vocalsound} to draw . Can I just draw the face ? Um yeah , I think you can just draw the face , but then you'll have to describe in writing how the rest of it looks . {vocalsound} Ooh . It's a cat . That's a very pr pretty cat . {vocalsound} Which also has what ? A big fat body and big {disfmarker} and a long tail . Okay , do y do you wanna do some {disfmarker} write {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Why ? you wanna just write some words about it ? Because um cuddly . And usually cats are very friendly . Usually . And they're healing as well . They heal . And they can feel when a human's got problems so {disfmarker} Wow , so they're kinda spiritual . {vocalsound} So , that's why I like cats . Well done . There we are , that's me . {vocalsound} Okay . {vocalsound} Um , I don't actually have a favourite animal , Mm . but for the for th for this meeting I'll s draw a little {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Mm-hmm . Uh . I honestly can't draw for toffee . Uh . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Really ? {vocalsound} Yeah . Oh that's a {disfmarker} {gap} no {vocalsound} {vocalsound} A prairie dog ? {gap} no {vocalsound} uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Oh a squirrel ? That's exactly what it is . {vocalsound} Uh not a very good one {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Not bad I would say . Yeah , that's pretty good . Okay , well , you got it's a s It's a squirrel , and I like them , because they're cute and stupid . {vocalsound} Very good . Ah . Alright . Right . Okay , so , I guess that was the test to see if this equipment is all working . {vocalsound} Mm . Let's move on to the next page . Okay , project finance , selling price twenty five Euros , profit aim fifty million Euros . Market range internationally sold . Yeah . Production cost , ah right it's gotta be {disfmarker} can't cost any more than twelve fifty to make . Ah right okay . {gap} experience with with remote control , so talk about who who's used what . Any ideas ? Stuff like that . Next meeting starts in thirty minutes . {vocalsound} At quarter to twelve . {vocalsound} So I think before we close uh , we are expected {disfmarker} I mean the last slide wanted us to maybe discuss longer what our what our ideas where . I mean if you wanna go back to the last slide . Uh {disfmarker} Yeah . S Yeah . Yeah , I think we're {disfmarker} I mean before we close the meeting , we're supposed to come up with some ideas for {disfmarker} Oh k so we're actually supposed to be doing this discussion like right now are we or {disfmarker} Yeah . Yeah . oh okay . Mm . Yeah . I thought this was just t giving us instructions for the re to do next , but {disfmarker} Yeah , I think this is just the preliminary , get some rough ideas for what our experiences with remote controls have been and and what we would {disfmarker} roughly what we would incorporate into a new one maybe . Okay . Right , who's got experiences with remote controls then ? Pretty much everybody . {vocalsound} Yeah . Yeah , I think we've all got {disfmarker} Uh . {vocalsound} Um . Is this a T_V_ one we are supposed to make ? Yeah . Yeah it's a T_V_ remote control . Okay . 'Kay um . Well . {vocalsound} T A new remote control for T_V_ . What would I like ? {vocalsound} Um . W what {disfmarker} You want it big do you want it small . Are we are we going for like like telephones are going little teeny tiny things or we are going for something that's that's big and {disfmarker} Medium . Mm . Yeah it seems like there's like {disfmarker} there's sort of a tension between two ideas , I mean , you want you want one remote that maybe can work uh all all of the functions of T_V_ and if you have whatever associated with T_V_ the D_V_D_ player , or something like that , {vocalsound} Video and ts hi-fi and stuff . but like at the same time you don't wanna really busy remote with a thousand buttons on it or something . Maybe you {disfmarker} yeah Mm . now th that's the other thing is it's gotta be cheap . Yeah . 'Cause I I I mean I was thinking something that's got different like maybe a a an L_C_D_ display on it that's got different pages for different devices , {vocalsound} but that would p that would probably be quite expensive . Mm . But how do we know how much uh , I mean , how much do we have per {disfmarker} how much ? Twelve fifty . Twelve fifty . {vocalsound} It g can't be more than twelve fifty per unit . Each . Per unit , yeah . Cost . So do we have to be realistic within the budget or {disfmarker} Well at the moment we could , wa I mean we {disfmarker} Close pr I don't know how much it would cost . Yeah . Guess {disfmarker} 'cause we this is what we th what we're doing at the moment is just saying what what we'd like , and then after we after we've found out what we can like , some different ideas , we can then go and do the research to find out if these {disfmarker} any of these ideas are feasible or not . Right . So would be nice to have something that that controls lots of different things . Yeah . Um . Couldn't we have like one that comes out ? {vocalsound} Like so you have one in like {disfmarker} mm Yeah . it doesn't have to be really thick . I mean remote controls can be thin bits . And then you have one for your D_V_D_ and you sort of slide it out , and then you have another one , you slide it out . {vocalsound} 'Kay . {gap} have slides . And then it all comes compact Okay , that's {gap} . into one . So it's not {disfmarker} you actually just putting three or four different remotes together but making them thinner , and um into one basically . {vocalsound} Th that's an idea . Yeah . So you just flip them out . Okay . Um {gap} have uh one very complicated one on one side with {vocalsound} all the D_V_D_ and V_C_R_ access and stuff , and then on the other side o {vocalsound} one uh a remote control that would be very very simple with just the channel , program plus and {vocalsound} minus , and the just the mute button , for example . I can real keep it really really simple on one side and the other side be very complicated . One side for kids , one side for adults . Yeah . {vocalsound} I'm not sure if that's like {disfmarker} Or grandma as well , you know it's like {vocalsound} what is the mute button . I'm not sure if it's a good idea to have a two sided remote though , 'cause it would be very hard to use in the way that you mani manipulate it . No , but you would slide it into uh someth like something on the back would hold {disfmarker} like you wouldn't be able to press the buttons , but {disfmarker} Oh . Like it {gap} Oh okay . or something like a flip telephone , something like that maybe . {vocalsound} Yeah . Okay . That would be cool . F flip it open and you've got all the buttons , or you flip it closed and you've just got the basic buttons on the outside maybe . I was thinking that like a flip . Mm-hmm . Um , oh we've got five minutes left . Start breaking up . But {disfmarker} okay . Okay . Um . Well we've got a k we've got a few ideas there . Yeah , we should uh {disfmarker} {gap} . I guess by the end of this meeting we should have at least a a rough conception {disfmarker} you know {gap} stage one was technical functions design , what effect the apparatus should have . Okay . Um so I mean we still have time in our next meeting to come up with the actual concept for the user interface , but the the functions that we're sure that we want are that it can control the T_V_ , but also devices connected to the to the T_V_ , I mean , be able to operate Yeah . D_V_D_ players , things like that . I have got {disfmarker} I think we should also have a back-up plan of {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} 'cause I I I just think that it might be expensive to make something that {disfmarker} I mean we don't , we haven't been told it has to be something that will control everything . We should have a back-up plan of just a really good television remote control , that just {disfmarker} that is just for a T_V_ , but it's just a really good , nice one . Yeah . Yeah . Okay . Right . What do you reckon ? See 'cause , {gap} I'm just thinking {disfmarker} bearing in mind th we've gotta {disfmarker} we have to have something that's cheap to make . Yeah , I mean {gap} . Yeah , that's true , maybe we should just concentrate on having a a good T_V_ remote , and have it be um {vocalsound} I think we'll be able to come up with ideas and stuff a lot quicker . have it be like ergonomic so it's comfortable to use , Yeah . uh simple to use , and looks decent and {disfmarker} May w you know , maybe even {disfmarker} But what'll make it what'll make it interesting for people to buy though ? Or maybe even so something that's for disabled people I mean if it's if it's just like {disfmarker} or so people that uh b don't see very well or {disfmarker} big buttons for {disfmarker} touchy buttons for {disfmarker} Sorta find a niche for our remote , like market it to a certain kind of p kind of people , Yeah . Yeah . Or just one that looks really fucking cool . certain certain demographic {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Mm-hmm . {vocalsound} Could be really light or , I dunno , something special . Yeah , no I think you're right . Yeah , rathe rather than focus on {disfmarker} Otherwise we'll be we'll be here all day talking about {gap} do this let's do that n I think we sh I think we should {disfmarker} Y {vocalsound} Yeah . Yeah , 'cause at the end of the day if it says just T_V_ remote , doesn't say com combination with all all the r {vocalsound} Yeah . Yeah . I mean obviously everyone {disfmarker} we're uh you know uh sounds like we're all a bit sort of gadget heads and we like things that do everything at once , but you know , that's {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Remotes spinning out from other remotes and having little nested remotes inside . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} Mm . Yeah , that's right . Yeah . I mean I'd like one that makes tea as well , but {vocalsound} that's not gonna happen . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} I think a flip up thing , 'cause you always have this problem of like if it's on this {disfmarker} well I did anyway , like we had five or six remotes and they would be lying on the c on the coach , and you'd come and sit down and {disfmarker} ooh , the telephone's {disfmarker} the television switched on or something . So maybe something that like does have a lid or closes , so you don't accidentally press a button or record button for something . Okay , like a lock f like a lock functs function on it like you have on your telephones , yeah . Yeah . But make it like really snazzy and cool {gap} people will want it . So make it {disfmarker} Yeah . Yeah , it's gotta be sellable . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah , that's true what you were saying , I mean it doesn't have to have a flip function , it can just have a lock function , so that it's not uh not usable when you don't want it to be usable . Yeah . Mm . Mm . {vocalsound} Yeah . Okay . And even for kids as well . It's um it's safer for them , I guess . Like they don't flick onto channels and all that sl flick onto . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} No porn channel for children . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Okay . Um alright , Okay . {vocalsound} so we've got some ideas , we've got um {disfmarker} I guess that's good good for now . Let's move on . Mm . Oops , let's close that . Next meeting , uh okay . W What does I_D_V_I_D_N_M_E_ stand for ? Industrial Designer um which is {disfmarker} Ah ri okay . {gap} these are requirement specification . Um . That's {disfmarker} Mm . And I'm marketing . Yeah , there you go . {vocalsound} So {gap} {disfmarker} User Interface Designer , that's that's That's me . Okay . that's you , so you gotta {gap} you go , you're you're gonna be the one that's working out what what buttons we need . Um . Right . Right . Industrial Designer , you are the one {gap} , you know , you're gonna be working out kind of box it goes in , I guess so , um whether it's {gap} what goes into the box , somehow . Mm . Har how it works an And in marketing {disfmarker} Bu {vocalsound} These are requirement specification . User requirements specifications . So what the user requires Yeah , what {disfmarker} Do you think our two kind of overlap , because {disfmarker} in a remote . Right , okay , yeah . Yeah , it does seem like our our responsibilities have some overlap . I guess that's what it says . You two {vocalsound} you two are gonna be just , I think , you just double up , you know , you {disfmarker} working together . Yeah . Yeah . You're the one that's gotta go and find out {disfmarker} do th do the research , see what people want in a remote , what buttons are used more often , and s stuff like that . Mm . {vocalsound} Oh , we've been warned to finish the meeting now . Okay . Okay everyone , well done . {vocalsound} Good meeting . Alright , see you in thirty minutes . {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} So {vocalsound} , do we take these off ? I don't {disfmarker}",
        "summarize": "The team got warmed-up through the opening drawing game which also works as the tool training process. The meeting was primarily composed of discussions among team members on potential functions and designs of remote controls based on their own life experiences. By then, feasibilities on budgets and demographic marketing strategies were also taken into consideration which influence greatly the potential functions and designs."

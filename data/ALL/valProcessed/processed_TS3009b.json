        "transcript": "Great man . Who starts ? Well I'll uh start just with another presentation , so then we can uh look at th at the agenda uh for this meeting . Alright , great . Alright . {vocalsound} Okay . I've put some uh new things in the in the map . Mm-hmm . Uh oh . {vocalsound} This is it . I don't know the shortcut , so {disfmarker} Ah F_ five . Well our functional design meeting , that's the stage we're in . Mm . And you also ha all three of you have uh prepared something about it . Yes . Well um in we'll uh just have a look at the at the notes from the previous meeting , what we uh thought we had dec decided . But uh {disfmarker} Uh then we'll uh look at uh the three uh presentations uh from you . I think you have prepared uh all three uh ? {vocalsound} 'Kay . Well , yeah . Yeah . Um we'll look at th the new project requirements we uh {disfmarker} I dunno . Y you also have uh received that mail , the new project requirements from our bosses ? No . {vocalsound} Oh I've received a mail with uh some additional requirements , No . You're the only one . {vocalsound} and I'll have a look if {disfmarker} Oh . Alright . Well I think we should show them before your presentations , because it's not really uh smart uh to uh to include some things uh we can't , because of the new requirements . Well um then we can make some decisions about our remote control functions . 'Kay . We have to deb we have to decide it in this meeting what our function will be . And then uh we can discuss uh some more closely . Uh {disfmarker} We have forty minutes for this uh discussion ? Uh yeah , I think so . {vocalsound} Alright . Well uh {gap} the closing uh we'll not uh look at it yet . {vocalsound} Alright . Um {vocalsound} now I'll look at {gap} show {gap} this board . Um {disfmarker} Well uh notes , first meeting . Now . I gave a disc a a presentation . Uh we familiarised ourself with the boards and then we discussed some first ideas . So we said that uh we have to merge the strong points from our uh competitors , and uh look at their uh remote controls . Right . We should make it uh compatible with our new D_V_D_ and other releases we have , our technical releases . Huh ? Uh not too many one buttons . One recognisable button in the middle , where you do the most important functions with . And um well they can have two functions , because uh you have a D_V_D_ and a television . {vocalsound} Yeah . Um the design has to fit the hand , be original , but also be familiar . {vocalsound} It's uh one of our ideas . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah well that wa It's just thirty minutes ago , {vocalsound} so it's not quite uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} But well I have to do it . Mm-hmm , now it's right . {vocalsound} Yeah . The materials uh well should be hard plastic with rubber from {gap} , and uh well the labelling of the buttons should be indestructible . It should be uh recognisable at all times . {vocalsound} It's meant to be easily wiped out , yeah . {vocalsound} Yes . Mm . Okay . Well fronts were to be {gap} just like mobile telephones . And uh the technical aspects um {disfmarker} And also labelling of the buttons , the functions should be universal standards . Well that's just uh some ideas from the first meeting . It's quite logical al all of it . Mm-hmm . Um now the new project requirements , I'll just show them . I got this mail from uh our bosses . Well , teletext goes out . We will not use teletext . Oh . Okay . Maybe a new sort of thing , but n but not teletext . I I disagree , but uh it's not uh t it's not my place to disagree I guess . Well {disfmarker} the second is a bit sh pity because we just said we wanted to d include the D_V_D_ Oh . and they don't want it , because of our time we have for this project . Alright . Oh , alright . Oh , that's a shame . So that's a shame , because uh especially for the third requirement we want to reach people under the thirty years . Because uh we don't have those customers a lot at th at this point . Um well it's a bit pity because it's just those people want to have uh one remote control for all those technical devices they can uh reach it . Yeah . But let's forget about it . It's just time-consuming , Yeah . so we uh have to go on . {vocalsound} Well and uh our corporate image should stay rec recognisable in our products . So uh we have to uh use uh maybe a slogan , maybe a colour , and um {disfmarker} Yeah well uh on our remote controls the design has to be uh , well as we already said a actually , uh familiar . Uh not only just uh the shape but also our company . Yes . Yeah , we are a {vocalsound} real fashionable company . I read uh I read it on the {disfmarker} Yeah . {vocalsound} Yeah . Yeah . {vocalsound} I didn't know what company we were , Mm . but we we design uh especially trendy uh trendy trendy stuff . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah . Okay . So it has to be uh a modern design . That's important to know , uh when you design a thing of course . Yes . I I uh noted uh our uh slogan that we have , our company . It's uh we mm put the fashion in electronics . Yeah . So maybe that's a slogan we can put uh somewhere on our remote control or something . Right . Yeah . Alright then um we're going to uh have three presentations . Yeah . You want to start ? {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} I think I have to start . {vocalsound} Oh you have to start ? I didn't see anything about uh who had to start . {vocalsound} The order ? No . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Oh no , no problem . Well s then start . Mm . I I just have to uh to think which file's mine , {vocalsound} 'cause I was uh bit in a hurry . Okay . Well uh {disfmarker} I think it's this one . But I'm not sure . {gap} {gap} You already uh opened uh PowerPoint . Hmm ? Yeah . S Right . {vocalsound} Yes . This is it . Yeah . Well , I'm going to tell you something about functional requirements . Mm-hmm . Um to start with these points . Uh next sheet ? Um at first I tell you something about what people dislike about the current uh controls , because it's uh a smart thing to exclude those things . Uh , furthermore it's very important what they do like and what they do use . {vocalsound} Um then I tell something about um the most important issues . So we have to focus on those three thing three things . And in the end I'll um show you our target {vocalsound} audience or our target product users , customers . Well , {vocalsound} um the first findings are that people um think most controls are very kind of ug ugly . {vocalsound} That's seventy five per cent of the current users . They don't like it , so we might think about fronts in that section . Um {disfmarker} They also say , that's about uh I thought it was fifty per cent , uh that more money will be spent on uh better looking controls . So it's very important that you design a a nice looking control . {vocalsound} Um the current user uses his machine just about well all of the time for a few functions . Uh , almost every user uses it d the the control for just ten per cent of its capacity . So it's really important to make the the buttons for the common uh tasks kind of big or kind of uh flashy . Furthermore , it's uh {vocalsound} seventy five per cent of the users uh zaps a lot . Thus it might be uh might be smart to make a a big uh zapping button or something in the middle , so you can reach it with your thumb . {vocalsound} You can zap away . Yeah . {vocalsound} Yeah , yeah right . Yeah . Right . A lot of losers um users lose their controls in their {vocalsound} in their living room . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} So it might be sensible to make some kind of a button on your television , that's your um your control beeps or something , that you can find this very easily . {vocalsound} Well {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Yeah . I dunno , maybe that's an idea . Oh . 'Cause it's uh a big {disfmarker} I think fifty per cent of the users loses his its control , within the same room . {vocalsound} Oh ? It should actually uh {disfmarker} It should actually be loose from the television , {vocalsound} Yeah . because it can also be used for other televisions . So if you deliver a small uh click-on device that you can put on your television , that bleeps to your remote control , everyone can use it . Yeah but what if you lose your click-on device ? No you can click it on your television . Yeah but if someone d somebody else uses it in ano other room or something ? {vocalsound} Yeah in another room , yeah . {vocalsound} Well yes . Nee but it it specifically says it's uh the the control is lost in the same room . {vocalsound} Yeah . Mm-hmm . So {disfmarker} Well a beeping device would be {disfmarker} Well we'll have a look at it , yeah . Uh furthermore the learning time is a problem . Uh thirty four thirty four per cent um thinks it's it's too uh too difficult to learn . So the the learning curve should be very short uh for the dumbest people should be able to use it . {vocalsound} I think our uh user uh expert should also consider manual a manual for the remote , of course . Uh {disfmarker} Yeah but people don't read manuals . I didn't read it ? No . Oh , alright . No . {gap} users to uh add one ? Do you think ? I don't think {disfmarker} I think you should put more time in the in the design of uh pick up and use , than a manual . Yeah . Yes you should {disfmarker} You should could take a look at it and and and know how it how it's supposed to work . {vocalsound} Mm-hmm . Yep . Yeah alright . Because they don't use it ? Alright . Well there sh should always be a menu , Yeah . Right . but it c can be very short . And it should be consistent with consistent with older remotes . Yeah but nobody reads a manual about a remote control , I think . Yes okay . Well maybe for the {disfmarker} If you don't recognise a button who d who d who do I call uh wh when I don't know it ? Alright . Yeah right . It sh it should be there , the manual . But but not to explain how the remote works . Only {disfmarker} {gap} And we don't have much time . So it's better to uh put our attention to the the design . So you can pick up and use it , than {disfmarker} I think . Well we are a design team , Hmm . we can say to some uh writer uh make a manual point . {vocalsound} Isn't it part of the of the u Yeah right , right . So {vocalsound} No . No . Never mind . Well we'll have a look . Um yes ? Next point . Um R_S_I_ . {vocalsound} Well that's about twenty per cent I thought . But uh the designer should uh take it uh {vocalsound} should uh {disfmarker} Wie zeg ik dat ? Yeah , consider the consequences of using your remote . Consider the m Yeah . It should be a good in your hand . {vocalsound} Mm-hmm . Yep . Right , this is the most important part . Um , we're {disfmarker} Like the requirements said , we're gonna specify of we're gonna target a younger audience . Um , {vocalsound} that's about sixty per cent of the market , so it's uh quite important . Um research shows that they like to have a little L_C_D_ screen on their on their uh zapping uh device . Uh {disfmarker} I thought it was the age between sixteen and twenty , ninety nine per cent of uh the people like that . Well {disfmarker} So it's very important we should definitely have that in our uh designs . Well with twelve Euro fifty as production cost , we can't uh afford an L_C_D_ uh {disfmarker} It's going to be expensive . Yeah . No . Yeah but {vocalsound} they think it's really important . Yeah . So if we want to s If we have a big {disfmarker} {vocalsound} If we make lots of uh of the stuff , maybe we can uh buy it very cheap , I dunno . We have to uh {disfmarker} Well {disfmarker} Well we'll uh consider it uh . Yeah well uh it's your your task to uh look into the costs uh of those uh {disfmarker} We'll think abo we'll think {disfmarker} Yeah , I don't know . I don't have any information on that . So {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Nigh {vocalsound} I know . {vocalsound} No , we'll look we'll look into that later . Alright ? Right . And uh another thing is uh speech uh recognition . They also like that , {vocalsound} but research is very uh costly . So {disfmarker} I think that's uh difficult to realise also . Yeah , but {vocalsound} it {vocalsound} it might be important for the sale . We have very demanding clients . It's not yet a standard uh development uh those so {disfmarker} {vocalsound} No and we have customers in multiple uh countries I think . We sh Well I do think L_C_D_ is more reachable than the speech recognition . Yeah absolutely . Yeah . So we might consider L_C_D_ screens . {vocalsound} No . Yeah , yeah , alright . Well we'll consider both and and see what uh what what we can find , I think . Yep . We don't rule them out uh yet . Alright . {gap} 'Kay . Alright . Um , I think that's it . Um {disfmarker} Alright . I think it is sensible to u uh to take this take these points into the notes . Yes . So you can {disfmarker} Right . Well you {disfmarker} I c I can uh still see your presentation . Yeah . Right . It's in the {disfmarker} Well uh next um I dunno who is next . Oh you go . Shall I give a technical talk ? Yes . Alright . Well go ahead . {vocalsound} Well uh it is my task to uh explain uh or to point out a working design . Yip . {vocalsound} We have that here . Okay , how do you enlarge it , so that you can have the {disfmarker} F_ five . F_ F_ five . {vocalsound} F_ five . Yep . {vocalsound} Well , the working design , Alright . {vocalsound} that's my uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Next button . {vocalsound} Well alright uh , you know who I am and what I do . So uh we have this . It's a bit uh unclear because I wanted to copy paste something . It was originally in black and white Oh right . but it became black and purple . Purple {vocalsound} . But I think you can read it . {vocalsound} {gap} {vocalsound} Yeah , yeah , yeah . A bit . Um well um I think it's important uh for you to realise the basic function of a remote control . Uh well you can see uh {disfmarker} Maybe you can select it . So it uh inverts . {gap} And I then can select I can select on the dings {gap} It goes to the next page . {gap} the p the whole picture . Click . {vocalsound} Nah , uh never mind . Well , you can read it , Yeah , go ahead . it's not too difficult . Meanwhile , this is a schematic uh um view of uh how a basic remote control works . You have uh basically uh the energy , the power of the of the remote control , uh and the sender , w which is the LED , the the the the the the the the the bulb that sends the the infrared beam to the , no , to the set . Yeah . Alright . And uh the source is of course the user . Uh the user interface is um {vocalsound} uh the {vocalsound} the {gap} the buttons of course . {vocalsound} And the {vocalsound} the user interface sends uh the the different signals of the different buttons to the chip , and the chip uh sends it to the LED , and the LED sends it to the receiver . That's the that's the basic idea . Yep . Very basic . {vocalsound} Um well I have uh {vocalsound} uh {vocalsound} put it in a in in in a {vocalsound} a couple of basic steps . {vocalsound} Uh the remote uh is basically just waiting for a user to press a key . It does nothing until uh of course uh the key is pressed . The key {gap} a signal to a chip , uh the chip senses the connection . {vocalsound} uh and recognise the key . So {vocalsound} well you understand . {vocalsound} The chip uh produces Morse code , um a specific code to indicate that specific button that is pressed , of course . And it uses transistors in the in the remote control to amplify and to send uh that signal again to the to the LED , which is the bulb , of course . {vocalsound} Now the LED produces an infrared beam and signals the , well it's uh very simple , and signals the uh signals to the sensor on the T_V_ set , Yeah . {vocalsound} and the T_V_ set uh also recognises the the {vocalsound} the signal , and performs the assigned task . So it is also why we have to have a button that says uh I'm now busy with a D_V_D_ uh if we had done that . And a button for T_V_ . So {disfmarker} Ah bu Yeah , but we don't . Uh we {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} No no , but {disfmarker} Yeah . Exactly . Uh well this is uh the basic uh function of a remote . {vocalsound} I've some couple of pictures here . It's a very basic one . And uh {gap} if we if we're going to add an uh an uh L_C_D_ screen to it , it uh won't look anything like this , but {disfmarker} This is very basic uh basically the the shape of um of a remote control . It has uh very little buttons and {disfmarker} {vocalsound} But it it uh it's it's quite um {disfmarker} Yeah , you can easily recognise the buttons . They're uh far enough apart and an anything . It's not very um uh not very high-tech uh High tech . {vocalsound} indeed , and it's not very user-friendly . Uh if you look at the shape , it's uh just a simple long box uh shape . So we have to uh change a little bit uh to that , uh so that uh it becomes more user-friendly , and that uh problems like uh R_S_I_ and uh those kinds of thing don't don't oc don't occur . Right . Can I say something ? Yeah . Um I have a table here about uh the l the relevance of the buttons . Uh the power button is used very much , channel selection , volume and teletext . Well teletext is not an option , so that uh {disfmarker} Mm-hmm . But I think it's very important to make um the power , channel and volume buttons uh near to the thumb , so you can't have R_S_I_ uh consequences . Yeah , because they are the the most important buttons and you can immediately {disfmarker} Right . Make them big , make them easy to uh to press . Well but but {vocalsound} You can also like {disfmarker} You don't have to look and and search for them . if you have um the most used buttons all in one place , and you keep making the same um well moves . Right . Yeah , I was thinking you can {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Yeah , right . Right . But if y if you would put it at a different place , then you have to move your hands , {vocalsound} and that's on of the things about R_S_I_ . Are some of the the the um {disfmarker} Yeah , that's right . That's right . That's right . Well you you can't have any uh every button {vocalsound} under the thumb , of course . We No but the most important buttons m maybe you can just put them a bit apart so you would reject R_ R_S_I_ R_S_I_ . But {disfmarker} Yeah . That's very important . And {disfmarker} Maybe you can make , for for channel changing , two little buttons on the side of the remote , so you can just do like this . Like some uh little uh Gameboy things or some Yes I've saw that on m on mi mobile telephones they also have uh those buttons . But is that is that useable ? Hmm ? Do people , uh when they pick up a remote , know that they have to do that ? {vocalsound} Well {disfmarker} It's a f it's a new feature , Well it it's {disfmarker} Yeah . you can make make a double feature l like a button on the top and under it . Yeah alright , but {disfmarker} Well also i if someone puts {vocalsound} picks up his uh remote {disfmarker} Yeah , but if you s say them up and down , they they'll understand it {gap} , I think . Yeah . If someone puts up i uh picks up his remote , and he picks up it he he touches the side then he's a already on the next channel . Eighty per cent would . Well , {gap} . Yeah , he feels it immediately . That's very irritating , I think . Yeah that's true . Yeah , that's right . Yeah . Yeah but {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Right , continue . But in e in any case the the basic function should be uh indeed , and as you say at the thumb . Sorry . {vocalsound} I think that's a good idea , and uh and that the less important uh buttons , like the the the different channels , uh the numbers one two three four five as well , should be uh yeah well not in reach , because uh they don't use it uh all the time . Well it's uh pretty pretty {vocalsound} basically uh as you said . Yep . And I have some pictures of the inside workings , but uh I don't want to get too technical , Mm-hmm . because uh that's not uh very uh useful for you . {vocalsound} That's your part of the job . {vocalsound} Yeah , that's right . So yeah {gap} exactly {gap} this is uh how it uh looks from the inside . Yep . And uh well that's about it I think . Oh yeah , I still have this . Oh I had to delete this , but I had to make a schematic uh of the of the new {disfmarker} Alright . {vocalsound} Okay . But I had too too little time , {vocalsound} but uh don't uh don't look at it please . {vocalsound} Well we understand . I I think it's it's clear uh how it works . Alright . We understand . Yeah , it's clear . Oh right , no . Alright . That's the most important thing . Nice . Then uh Mike can uh give the third presentation . Alright . Uh {disfmarker} How late is did we start his presentation uh ? {gap} Right . {vocalsound} I dunno . I think uh w About twenty minutes ago ? Wha Yeah . Losing time losing time . {vocalsound} Well then we have still the time , so {disfmarker} {vocalsound} But we do have to come to a decision , right later on . Yeah right . So {disfmarker} So {disfmarker} Mm . {vocalsound} {gap} Well I thought um everybody on the website {vocalsound} uh would see the same thing , but obviously {vocalsound} that's not the case . I don't think so . Yeah , uh there are different uh {disfmarker} We have all have different home pages , with different links . Oh yeah ? Yeah . Yeah . Yeah right . Uh ? For instance you couldn't see this . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Okay , yeah well . Um {disfmarker} Yeah . Well I'm Mike {gap} , User Interface Designer . Mm-hmm . The the method ? Well {disfmarker} I used my own experience with remotes , took a good l look uh at the remotes on the corporate website , which are these two . Yeah . Um {disfmarker} These are already in use ? Yes , these are from from another uh manufacturer . Alright , okay . Um {disfmarker} This one is engineering-centred , so this one has the most functions and um things . Yeah . Mm-hmm . Um {disfmarker} Well {disfmarker} I like user-centred . Yeah , me too . I like user-centr centred uh {vocalsound} uh also the best . {vocalsound} Yeah . We also do that . Um {disfmarker} Well , I thought uh that we uh reduce the the option to control the D_V_D_ also , and teletext and that kind of stuff . Mm . Uh so I thought we we we would use more or need more buttons than this one . But we have to reject that , because of the requirements ? But {disfmarker} Yes . Yeah . Th that's why this mm is not relevant any more I feel . {vocalsound} Alright . Um {disfmarker} I think this is about the maximum number of buttons uh we'll need . Yeah , right . {vocalsound} I um I kinda like the shape . {vocalsound} I think this is what we talked about . But {disfmarker} {gap} You can't really see uh the differ from different sides . Yeah . But I think uh {disfmarker} No I've {disfmarker} Well I showed it somewhere . Um {disfmarker} Uh you can draw it if you {disfmarker} Yeah . {vocalsound} Oh yeah . I think we should go further with the idea of a removable front . Mm-hmm . So we can can uh yeah customise the {disfmarker} Well absolutely , but i th they all have to have something about um the recognition from our company . So we cannot just uh make someone w Mm ? {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} It's a front . It's not the the whole remote that changes , of course . No but that's th the side they look uh look at is the front . You can {disfmarker} But it {disfmarker} So if y if you make a a front with just a a tiger on it , then uh our recognition is totally gone . Mm . Yeah , that's right Or you can you can can put the same symbol on on every remote . Yeah , that's a must . So l like Ericsson does {gap} every uh {disfmarker} Yeah , we must . We can put it on the on the back side . We must have that . Yeah well and and {disfmarker} S something like this . {vocalsound} Yes . It's recognisable . 'Kay . Um {disfmarker} We can make a symbol of the company right here . And {vocalsound} if you put a front on it , there's a hole on the front . So the symbol's always on Yeah ? Yeah , so that you don't replace the symbol , yeah . Yeah yeah yeah . Yeah yeah . Something like that , Or the th the the lowest part of the remote isn't changed by the front . in the {disfmarker} Yeah . {disfmarker} Yeah . Yeah , yeah . Mm-hmm . Those kind of things . Yeah . But let's not focus on the front {gap} . {vocalsound} Yes . Okay . Um {disfmarker} Well so uh uh like I said I thought we'd we'd use more function . If we we had to include more functions . But we don't . So um {disfmarker} Mm-hmm . Yeah . I think this is about the maximum number of buttons we need . Alright . Maybe some less . Like eject we don't need , and some other buttons we don't need . I think uh {disfmarker} Mike , uh can you put uh that picture from me on the in the Word documents file ? In Map ? Yeah , I will . I think uh for the remote um uh less is more . {vocalsound} The less buttons the better the design . Um {disfmarker} Yeah . We should go with that concept I think . Yeah , I agree . I know . Alright . I've I've got another point . Yeah ? Um there are two target audi audiences , and we've uh chose for the younger one . Mm . Um , research has shown that um it's a high interested uh in features . They are high high interested in feature . But they are more critical . Fo Yeah , critical . The younger uh {disfmarker} So {disfmarker} The younger audience . Mm-hmm . So we must um must design uh a control that really speaks to the people . Well what if we um {disfmarker} I at I at home have a remote that has um the most familiar uh buttons on the top , and the bottom side of the front has a little clip , Mm-hmm . a f a little uh {disfmarker} You can click away and then you have f much more functions that most people don't use but s some do do . Mm-hmm . I think uh the most functions uh underneath that uh {vocalsound} uh {disfmarker} Clip aren't used much . Well but because you say they their features are important , they want m um a lot , No um mm usually {disfmarker} Yeah right . But {disfmarker} but not {disfmarker} Yeah , but what kind of features ? Like L_C_D_ screens and voice recognition . Yeah I think {vocalsound} m most {disfmarker} Yeah but {disfmarker} Yeah . But I've {disfmarker} Most uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Here , look at these numbers . The newest features are , like I said , are uh L_C_D_ and uh speech uh control . Our audience , these people , are very like these uh features . Yeah . Mm-hmm . Uh . You see ? So we must build in something , or they will to uh go to the concurrent . {vocalsound} Competitors . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah . Our competitor . Yeah . The concurrent ? {vocalsound} Competitors , right . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} So , I do think we have to uh have some features . Yeah . Well maybe w we could uh s Even though they cost a little more . On um some uh calculators you have lo those little little L_C_D_ th that you can click on or something , Right . Right . or that you can click uh out uh of the remote . And if if that's gives you a little bit of sta status information . Like a ticker-tape . Yeah . Which programme you are l watching or something . Yeah , that's nice . {vocalsound} Those kind of things , uh because you also have those uh those program recognition for your V_ V_C_R_s . And uh well if y if your remote picks that up also , you they can display which programme you're currently watching . Yeah , right . Yeah right . Yeah . Yeah . So it it just signals the the different uh sig uh the different symbols on the screen you have , Yeah . uh because if you change to s channel two you have two on the screen and two on your on your um on your L_C_D_ screen . {vocalsound} For example . It it could be such a little uh th that you can click in and out and you and you have it . Yeah , we should keep that simple too . Yeah . It will {disfmarker} {vocalsound} But should it uh really be uh clickable , uh {vocalsound} Well maybe . No not clickable . No , it should be uh integrated . or {vocalsound} or just integrate inside to try to make it d more trendy . {vocalsound} Nah , no no no . I think {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Yeah , just at at the top . So when you s {vocalsound} you sit like this you can can watch . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah , I think it should be at the top . something like on um some radios in car . You {disfmarker} Where it's , yeah , walking to {disfmarker} Yeah . {vocalsound} Yeah right . It's a ticker-tape idea . R_D_S_s or something . But that's of course uh a bit more uh expensive than uh the basic uh calculator design , with the scrolling text and {vocalsound} that kind of thing . Wa Yeah . Well I think it's you got {disfmarker} It just means it's a script that's uh keeps it uh rolling , Well it's just one script . {vocalsound} and it's not uh {disfmarker} That's five minutes off uh implementing time I think uh {disfmarker} Yeah , five minutes of ja ja for programming . Yeah . {vocalsound} So I don't think that's the issue . No . Alright . Alright , we go with the L_C_D_ screen ? Uh well I think so , yes . Um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Yeah well we we we still need to know how much that will cost . 'Kay . Right , I don't know if I can find that , but {disfmarker} We're g No but we're we'll have to look into that . Or maybe you will get that information uh {disfmarker} Um we can use this board again , I think . Next time . Yeah right . {vocalsound} Yeah . Uh we can put some um decisions about um the controls we want , th the issue . {vocalsound} Where is my presentation ? {vocalsound} Uh {disfmarker} Yeah , I understand what you're saying . {gap} Uh {disfmarker} We should have a general idea of how it's gonna look . Well {disfmarker} I mean we're all here now , I think . These I've already given you . So we have to decide on the different remote control functions . So we want to have a small L_C_D_ screen that's special . Right . At the top . Shouldn't we start with the most important parts ? Yes . At the top or at the bottom ? The L_C_D_ screen alright {gap} but we should start with the power button ? I think the top is more uh {disfmarker} Yeah . Uh {disfmarker} Yeah but {disfmarker} When you s How do you zap ? {vocalsound} You just sit in your chair ? {vocalsound} Huh ? Yeah but with with the L_C_D_ screen on the top it gets a bit unnatural . With the remote ? That thing is terrible . 'Cause most remotes have some space left at the bottom . {vocalsound} Yeah but that's where your hand ball might be . Uh {disfmarker} Yeah , no Mm . Yeah , I dunno . And then uh {disfmarker} We'll draw two , and then we'll see uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Maybe we should uh centralise the discussion here . {vocalsound} I dunno what uh you were talking about but {disfmarker} No {vocalsound} {gap} we are busy with something {gap} . Um he thinks {disfmarker} Yeah , right . He thinks it's better to put the L_C_D_ at the bottom , and I think it's better at the top . Well {disfmarker} Uh-huh . Why do you think it's better at the bottom ? Uh well because most uh remotes have um some space left at the bottom , and that way you can keep the shape recognisable for everybody . But your {disfmarker} I c But you just can put uh the the the the the whole interface a bit down , so that there's room for the for the interface . Yeah . Well I d I think that's that's ugly but {disfmarker} The the ticker {disfmarker} The L_C_D_ is like like small . {vocalsound} It's it's wide . Uh-huh . It's not not high . But {vocalsound} {disfmarker} Well I th I think Mike Mike has a point , {vocalsound} I th And and we can {disfmarker} {vocalsound} because um when when uh when I use a remote I l I hate the buttons but buttons at the at the bottom . Yeah . Power button always {disfmarker} Yeah . Yeah . Bottom . So and and I I like to use the ones on the top . Yeah , y you gotta zap like this or {vocalsound} you want to {disfmarker} Yeah . So when I u when I have to have an L_C_D_ s scr window {disfmarker} Yeah right . But {disfmarker} We're making a remote with {vocalsound} with a few functions you know . Well {vocalsound} that's {vocalsound} a bit exaggerated . Well , I agree with you {gap} . It's it's also more recognisable . We It looks more like a calculator to people , if you have the l the the the thing on top . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yes but we we we we don't want that . Yeah you don't want {disfmarker} We don't want them to look like a calculator . You want uh {disfmarker} Yeah it it it must be a remote . We want to look it like our original but familiar {disfmarker} Yeah w well , Yeah . but uh you don't have to throw uh um important aspe {vocalsound} important aspect like familiarity uh completely away , High-tech {gap} . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yea uh because {vocalsound} I think it's uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Maybe a bic uh better uh white uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} We White ? {vocalsound} I think it's still important to have it at the top , Width . Width . Uh format yeah format ? Line width ? Width ? because it's uh it's more familiar that way . {gap} Th that's not a problem . Yeah ? {vocalsound} When I draw here it {vocalsound} {disfmarker} Oh . Huh ? It's a bit off . Yeah , it's off . Well . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} A little a little bit . {vocalsound} It {vocalsound} it needs to be calibrated again . Well {vocalsound} {disfmarker} Well uh let's uh talk about that later uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Maybe you should another pen . {vocalsound} Maybe that's uh better . {gap} You e you only have one pen for that screen . Yeah . Where ? It's special pen . {vocalsound} Alright , we have to make a decision now , Yeah . because we don't have much time . Um {disfmarker} No . I think we have uh a few functions , and we can put uh the L_C_D_ above it , and still have lots of room at the bottom , where you can put your hand . Yeah . I I agree . I think it should be at the button , bottom . Bottom . The L_C_D_ . At the bottom ? Well I'm the {vocalsound} I I'm the designer , so um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} In a few minutes {disfmarker} At the bot Oh yeah , oh yeah , I totally agree . Yeah . Yeah . So {disfmarker} We are two uh V_S_ two . {vocalsound} Well but uh what what if we we first decide the different functions , {vocalsound} He's the boss . {vocalsound} and then look at the design . Yeah . Right . Great . Uh we uh we were busy with that . Because we have to decide this . Uh yeah we should uh summon the the different uh aspects of the thing . Yeah . So , we have the power button . And moreover I think that you two should be uh come to consensus about the L_C_D_ s . Yes . It's uh your it's your job . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Well we have a power button . Yeah of course . Uh it's uh . Yeah . W wh No it's our job . Guys ? For all of us I think . {vocalsound} While you have to agree , I can say {gap} it's like this and {vocalsound} you must agree . Yeah . Yeah , right . Guys ? Alright , let's keep it central . {vocalsound} We have a power button , setting buttons , L_C_D_ window , the number buttons {disfmarker} {vocalsound} The ten numbers ? Yeah ? Channel , yeah . Uh {disfmarker} Volume ? Volume control . Yes . Um {disfmarker} Uh the mute button . Well let's look at your uh design . Uh {disfmarker} Mm . I h love that one . {vocalsound} Uh-huh . I think we we should use something like this um to um {disfmarker} The the channel up and channel down button ? {vocalsound} Yeah , in circle , you know ? Yes . Yeah . Yeah yeah yeah . Well that's that's also design . And and a volume control also in it . Yes . Um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Right . {gap} Yeah . Well h ho But th th on this remote th these controls are for something else , a D_V_D_ player or something . So {disfmarker} Yes . Yes . They are for some uh video uh {disfmarker} Yes , as I already said , we could drop some of these buttons . {vocalsound} You should put that uh power button , channel and volume should have the most uh importance . Yeah . I think these should be in one big circle in the middle . Yeah , but what he said about R_S_I_ was {vocalsound} t kinda true . When {gap} {vocalsound} when you uh put them all in the same place , the most used buttons , you're doing the same thing all the time , {vocalsound} and that's just what R_S_I_'s all about . So it might be smarter to put them a little more away from each other . Apart . So people have to move their hand . And they get less uh complaints of R_S_I_ . Yeah , it's it's also not good to completely stay in one position constantly with one hand . {gap} That's what I always do , Y {gap} because all my i important buttons are the same place . {vocalsound} Yeah . It's good to move uh from time to time . Yeah . Yes ? Yeah but people don't like it when their buttons are all over the place . Um {disfmarker} Well not {disfmarker} They they need to be centred . No but now y W would we have to choose a way in middle ? Frequency of uh button use . Yes . {vocalsound} Um channels are uh most uh is most used within the hour . You can see . Uh-huh . {vocalsound} Volume hardly . So the the {vocalsound} channel uh channel buttons should be far far apart , I think , up and down . {vocalsound} Mm-hmm . No I don't think . {vocalsound} Oh . Up and down far apart from each other ? Far apart ? {gap} {vocalsound} You thinking uh about R_S_I_ ? Yeah but {disfmarker} Well not too much . {vocalsound} Yeah but {disfmarker} Y look at uh look at the frequency . No . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Nei not too much , but {disfmarker} {vocalsound} The other the other two uh frustrations are far more important . So {disfmarker} I think you can have the two buttons of up and down close together , but you don't have uh have to have volume control and and zapping button close together . Well for example the power button , you can {vocalsound} {disfmarker} Well they are used four times an hour , so {disfmarker} If someone is constantly z zapping , it's not going to miss , that it that the power button is not right beside it . Because I have someone {disfmarker} But the buttons is way . Nei nei nei n I I totally agree . So that one can be put away . But just {disfmarker} Yeah . Right . Yeah . I agree . The power button can uh be uh uh {disfmarker} Power bu button should be left at the top . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yes . And should and should be red . Oh man , Yeah . five minutes . {vocalsound} Yeah , well five minutes left . Right , just make some decisions . Yep . The most important things we have to uh {disfmarker} Um how are we going to do it with those numbers ? C c can you make you make {disfmarker} We can use uh the drawing board now , I think . Uh it it doesn't work well but {disfmarker} But it it would be pretty pretty uh nice if we could just draw a simple thing . Well I have it here . Yeah well that's going to take too too much time . I do think you have to keep you have to keep it central now . Yes . Mm . Yeah . Just uh you decide that , you decide that , Mm . Alright . Yes . and {vocalsound} ready . Well the L_C_D_ . Um you are Industrial , you are User Interface . So I think it's going to go to Mike . But you will have to make consensus with {gap} . {vocalsound} Yeah . Well {disfmarker} Well consensus , um {disfmarker} We we can put it in the middle , so {disfmarker} Well it's a bit hard , because we are going to be uh individually . Nei . We're {disfmarker} No {disfmarker} {vocalsound} That's a bit uh {disfmarker} We're deciding now , so {disfmarker} Yes . Top or bottom ? Well uh yeah I I still think it's it's quite important though to uh to have it at the top , so Yes it is . {disfmarker} Yeah . You say familiarity isn't important but {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Well what if we're going to now decide about the functions , and the design comes into the next round ? Plus the d th the design round is still to come huh ? Okay . Yeah d Yeah . Yeah , right . Okay . Alright these functions . Alright . As we we we we agreed , we do have a L_C_D_ . The number f Well yes , that's alright . So that's that's enough . Yeah . Yeah , okay . W the number function . Are we going to uh do it like uh on Mike's screen with uh one button that says I'm going to do a t two number digital ? No . How do you want it to do then ? Well just when you push a one one and {disfmarker} There's one two three four five six six seven eight nine zero . It it has to r recognise one as {vocalsound} there could still come more . No , {vocalsound} if you {disfmarker} On most T_V_s if you uh press two numbers shortly after each other , {vocalsound} d it {disfmarker} Oh , like that . Um {disfmarker} Yes . They'd recognise it . Alright so no button for that . Yeah . Th that's the most {disfmarker} Yeah . Yeah . That that's very easy . Yeah . No . Okay uh anyone any uh oth other functionalities of our uh remote ? I think these are the the most important functions . Do you still have the pictures over there ? Yeah . So {disfmarker} Yeah , that's about it . You do need the uh multi Or did uh {disfmarker} No , like this one . You do need them ? No , we'd uh just said we didn't uh {disfmarker} Yeah , I know . {vocalsound} But are we {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Well uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Alright , alright uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Now okay . {vocalsound} Um well because we can't integrate it with any other uh remotes , all those buttons on those pictures are uh irrelevant . So just for a television is that all we need ? Right . Yeah , it's most useable this way . {gap} basic function . Yeah . Teletext is gone . So all those buttons that {vocalsound} ar are to do with teletext {disfmarker} Oh screen placing . {vocalsound} We'll have uh those uh buttons about uh {disfmarker} And uh the two important ones we're l f forgetting . {vocalsound} Uh there's um {vocalsound} screen . You can make it wider and less wide . Yeah . And the button that you can go to A_V_ for your video . Right . Oh yeah . I do think we have to put that underneath a clip . Those two ? But it's just two , and we make a clip ? Uh just two just two under uh under uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Th that's a bit uh waste . We we can make {vocalsound} make uh a little row of like four buttons down here . Yes . Yeah . Okay , right . Or at the top . {vocalsound} I I think uh {disfmarker} Your L_C_D_ screen is going to go . {vocalsound} Or at {disfmarker} But you you can put uh two or three buttons under uh another section . Yeah alright then . Uh that's that's too complicated . Yes . You can just put it somewhere Yeah {disfmarker} They they aren't used much , not as much as those other , so you can put it somewhere {disfmarker} Oh , they can be small or round like buttons . Yeah s bit smaller and s Well uh and and I think more at the bottom . Yeah . Yeah or at the top , yeah . What do you think uh those those buttons ? Well I think they should in an in an isolated part of the remote . Above or down ? And w where ? Well we design it later . We have it , and we design later where everything goes . Yeah . Yes ? Yes . Yes . Well any other uh {disfmarker} Well if you {vocalsound} you take those th If you {vocalsound} {disfmarker} Why go to video ? Go to video , that's always on your remote control . To A_V_ uh to A_V_ A_V_ A_V_ . Yeah , but you can z you can zap t you can you can zap to the video channel from zero to uh {disfmarker} The the video channel uh ? That's just zero . Yeah . Well l n no not at not at my remote . No no not always . Ze yeah zero is a different channel than uh the the video channel . {vocalsound} Yeah . Yeah , but you can can zap down {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Yeah , but when you zap down zero you get to A_V_ . Yes . I don't . Yes , I think th I go to ninety-nine . {vocalsound} No , then you press ninety nine . Ah uh well whatever , {vocalsound} . I think go to video is an irrelevant button , but {disfmarker} Th that's the button uh {disfmarker} No . But it's easy to go {disfmarker} {vocalsound} If you are at uh at channel uh fifty five and you want to uh go immediately to the video channel , you do you have to push a to to get below zero . No you can ch push zero . Yeah . Yeah , It's more easy to get to uh where the specific uh video channel button . I I think that one button is uh {disfmarker} I use it uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Yeah , but if we're choosing to uh incorporate these buttons , you have to have uh channel setting , if you wa if you have a new T_V_ . You have to set the channels . Yeah ? Right all th these uh different buttons you have to {disfmarker} These buttons , I don't have buttons for channel setting uh especially on my remote . Yeah well uh d different screen settings a Yeah , sk {vocalsound} Ah , I do . {vocalsound} It's it's incorporated with p m plus and down , uh those {disfmarker} Yeah well y you must have . Yeah y you you you you have screen width . Yeah you yeah you have one one button from {vocalsound} s set frequency o or something , {vocalsound} and then with plus and min minus you can uh adjust the uh {disfmarker} Right . That's the only one we put uh in there . So we still {gap} have one uh four ? For a screen uh fu uh channel setting . Ch ch Yeah to uh oh yeah of course to configure the programme the {disfmarker} Yeah . Programme , right . Okay . Oh the Okay button ? {vocalsound} Uh {disfmarker} Oh you always have in the centre an Okay button , for your menu . Yeah , alright . Yeah . Menu button . You should {disfmarker} Yeah . I think that's important . Channel , setting , menu . Uh {disfmarker} {gap} And and the settings to change the brightness {vocalsound} {gap} We have to go . {vocalsound} the settings to change the brightness and the contrast . {vocalsound} Okay . Channel , yeah . So um Save . {gap} Chief ? Chief ? Yes see . Th the menu menu button is also important . Yes I have put it in . Then you can uh {disfmarker} Where ? {vocalsound} I don't see it . Here . Oh Menu , alright . {vocalsound} I think things like uh contrast and brightness should be um in the menu , yeah . In the menu . And you can uh then adjust it with the zapping buttons or something . Yeah , the {disfmarker} Alright . Because uh the zapping buttons aren't used then if you are in the menu . Or the volume or something like that . Guys ? Yeah . Or the volume , yeah . We're going to uh go to our uh rooms , and uh we'll have to decide s things on our own I think . So {disfmarker} Your pen . Ah . Great . Yes chief . {vocalsound} Alright . Well see you uh {disfmarker} I thought we'd uh lunch uh right now , or not ? W w we have lunchtime , by the way , now uh so uh {disfmarker} Yeah this is this is your thing . Yeah , lunch break . Ah . Okay . {gap} I am hungry . {vocalsound} Lunch . {vocalsound} Get into my belly . {vocalsound} Ah . We didn't exactly do everything but {disfmarker} {vocalsound} So {disfmarker} {gap} {vocalsound} See you later mate . {vocalsound}",
        "summarize": "This meeting was about the functional design of the remote control. Firstly, the Project Manager mentioned new requirements including one recognizable button in the middle, the handy design, rubber materials and they would not use teletext. Next, Marketing presented on functional requirements including a fancy look, ease of use, and the LCD as well as speech recognition. Then, Industrial Designer introduced technical design and working design on remote interfaces. Lastly, User Interface presented on component design and the group decided to adopt a user-centered approach to reduce the main buttons and put a big circle in the middle with the power button, channel, and volume buttons."

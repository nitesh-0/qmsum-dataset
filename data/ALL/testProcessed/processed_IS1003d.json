        "transcript": "{vocalsound} {gap} {gap} Mm-hmm So , ready ? {gap} 'Kay No not really Just {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Crap . {vocalsound} Sorry , {vocalsound} I I um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Okay . It's perfect . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Your judgement it's {disfmarker} is biased . {vocalsound} I'm afraid {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Uh thi this remote control will stay a prototype . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} 'Kay , so whe where is the remote control ? {vocalsound} So , we are {vocalsound} Where ? {vocalsound} {vocalsound} It's here . {vocalsound} So {vocalsound} let's go for our detailed design meeting . Okay . Yep . So I will still play the role of the secretary , and we'll have um first the project presentation by our User Interface Designer , David Jordan , Okay . {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} and our Industrial Designer , Baba . Yeah . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} So we'll have to evaluate the uh {disfmarker} your proposed remote control , 'Kay . and um have an idea of the price that uh this thing will cost . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {gap} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} And in case if we're {disfmarker} we all agree on the fabrica of um building of this remote control , we'll evaluate the um production . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} So maybe I will let the {disfmarker} our two designers talk about so their {disfmarker} I have slides . You have s oh , sorry . Okay . Oops . Ah , Effectively one slide and maybe we can discuss everything . Product prod What slides ? Yep . Okay . Okay . {vocalsound} So , this is our product or prototype . This is made by clay . Looks strange . {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} Uh the basic colour is uh yellow and red . Yellow is uh our company colour , Okay . uh red it's uh is more attractive . So we used two basic colour , yellow and red . And the shape , there's two basic shape . The first is a circle and the second is a triangle s piece . Okay . It's {disfmarker} we call it a mushroom design . {vocalsound} It's looks like some mushroom , so we call it mushroom design . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah . Uh {disfmarker} So this is a introduction of our product . {vocalsound} Genetically modified mushroom I will say , but Next a mo Yeah . {vocalsound} Okay , {vocalsound} {disfmarker} keep on speaking . yeah , so next slide . So there are several key features of our pr prototype . The first is that it is fuzzy . I'm sure this would be the unique design the market . {vocalsound} Oh . {vocalsound} Yeah , yeah I'm sure {vocalsound} . {vocalsound} Maybe , I hope so . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah , so it's a fuzzy design , and a unique design . Yeah , that's true . Um , and uh the second key feature is that uh s circle channel um selection . In the traditional key uh traditional controller use button to to select the channel but now we have a s circle , so we can turn this ball to t to select channel . Chan So it's quite convenient for user to use it . Yeah , okay , but don't touch {disfmarker} don't destroy your prototype . {vocalsound} Yeah , s {vocalsound} {vocalsound} okay . Uh the third feature is a stable triangle base . Uh this sta uh this triangle base is very stable , so uh so it's it's um it's unlikely you cannot found it . So it's v Um , you can put it in the table so you can turn the the ball to cha to select the channel and there's some cute button . You c can can you can see the the shape of the buttons n is a mushroom , so {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Everything's mushroom . So we can call our remote control the mushroom . Yeah {gap} . Yeah , everything's mushroom . Mush Mushroom design , yeah . Yeah but it's not like really mushroom because you have uh you know uh {vocalsound} like lemon shape , you know , centre {vocalsound} is yellow and t d Yeah Okay . Yeah , th that's why if you put it in the table , be careful , somebody will eat it . {vocalsound} To integrate , you know {disfmarker} yeah . {vocalsound} I don't think {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I hope nobody will eat it {gap} You know , to integrate the fruit aspect , you know the {vocalsound} the {vocalsound} in Oh . Yeah Yeah , because mushroom was not in the trends . I mean there was fruits {disfmarker} yeah . {vocalsound} Yeah . Fruits and vegetables . Really ? But {disfmarker} Fruit and vegetable , Vegetables . Mushroom is a vegetable . so mushroom was a kind of you know {gap} uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Yeah . I don't think it is . It's vegetable . Mushroom ? Yeah . Mm-hmm . Oh , uh I'm not sure . {vocalsound} So th it's something eatable . We can {disfmarker} it's a veg a kind of vegetable , Yeah . but you know we we integrated them with different colour . Yeah . But anyway this is not a mushroom anyway , so it's fine . Yeah . {vocalsound} {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I think we take into account what you said about fruit and vegetable {gap} you know . This , you know , very enlighted colours , you know . No , I mean , yeah {vocalsound} yeah . Inspira inspiration is {disfmarker} And inspired colour {vocalsound} and {vocalsound} and very sophisticated material , so . True . And so {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Yeah . Next slide . Uh , no this our only two slides . {vocalsound} {gap} So what we w what I can add is that , you know {vocalsound} he talk about what is outside , so what is inside is what we dis what we talked before about , you know , the chip , Yeah . it is a low level chip , and {disfmarker} So we cut it to see . {vocalsound} You know , we don't need to k {vocalsound} . Mm-hmm . You know wi {vocalsound} the low level chips inside and you know the L_C_D_ button and the i Okay . So where's the battery battery ? The battery it is under {gap} . In the base . It is in th in {disfmarker} in the base , yeah . {vocalsound} In the basement . In the basement . Base . Here ? And where is the solar solar cell ? {vocalsound} But we say uh we sa we said solar . Where is the solar cell ? In fact this this this this is a kind of you know revolutionary solar receptor that we can put outside and {disfmarker} Oh . Do you think it won't be {disfmarker} It won't cris increase the price ? Okay {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {gap} I don't think so , Okay , we'll see after . {vocalsound} but it it's might be okay , so . We will have first to {disfmarker} I it might be okay . So {disfmarker} so , mister money , what's your opinion according to this remote control ? Yeah . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} I mean , we gonna try to measure how good it is instead of just talking about {disfmarker} uh {vocalsound} {vocalsound} we had three keys {disfmarker} {vocalsound} key points to uh for this remote control design , {vocalsound} and first one was uh Mm-hmm . fancy look and feel . Yeah . Yeah . So w we'll try to judge this feature uh with a one to seven scale , one being uh no , I think . {vocalsound} Uh just let me check . So , four point {disfmarker} three point five , it means it's acceptable . One one being true , and seven being false . Okay . Oops . Ouch . So Okay . Do we have a fancy look and feel , according to you ? Yeah , I think so . I think you have nice colours . {vocalsound} I don't {disfmarker} {vocalsound} But is it {disfmarker} The sha the bowl shape people like . Yeah , the shape is unique , and the colour {disfmarker} Uh I'll agree it's unique , but is it really {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Is it really fancy ? {vocalsound} So it depend on how d do you define fancy . Yeah I mean , fancy was was defined by s fruit and vegetable look . {vocalsound} But it's {disfmarker} you have the lemon aspect of this th this {vocalsound} this thing . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} Maybe if you change {disfmarker} if you take the buttons out , and maybe do things like that {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Do Don't do that , please . I dunno where the lemon is , but {vocalsound} I it's it's i this shape is a lemon like , so {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I mean it's not obvious . It would be bet more like a lemon ? Yeah . {vocalsound} If {disfmarker} Because i I dunno , maybe improving the texture of like having it less smooth or {disfmarker} Yeah . Less button . Uh so , my mush {disfmarker} . {gap} Looks like more fruit . Maybe a pineapple ? Yeah , but you don't have any button now . Mm . Yeah . I dunno . And you know , you have the finger here , with the buttons ? Yeah . That's uh yeah , is that {disfmarker} Hmm . that's a good idea . Yeah , it's getting {disfmarker} It looks {vocalsound} more like a pineapple . So that's great . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Sorry . That's great . {vocalsound} What's the use for that ? I have no idea , so . {vocalsound} Uh , for turn turn the ball . If you want to turn the ball , it's very it's very convenient for you to to to turn the ball to change the channel . {vocalsound} I have no idea {vocalsound} what {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} And where is the voice recognition ? Okay . Uh . Ah , it's embedded , your microphone . {vocalsound} Okay . Th this th th there's two two functions . Yeah , that's {disfmarker} Wait th that's the second point . This is microphone array {disfmarker} First one is we have to judge the fancy look and feel . If it is fancy or not . Okay . Is it better like that ? I mean {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Looks {disfmarker} okay , So we can we can say t {vocalsound} let's say it's a pineapple now . {vocalsound} The colour , is the colour acceptable ? {vocalsound} No , the colour is okay , that's fine . So the shape now . I mean it's {disfmarker} It looks like a {vocalsound} {disfmarker} but I would say there is more {disfmarker} too much red . now you took it . It's too much red ? Um if In the basement ? It looks like a pineapple with cherry on top . {vocalsound} Okay . {vocalsound} Right . So , from one to seven ? {vocalsound} I will give {disfmarker} I will {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Mm uh {disfmarker} Seven is the ma the maximum ? I'll gi No , seven is false and one is true . I'll give two or three . Three , I will say three . Three , it's okay . Three , three . Three is fine for me . Three ? 'Kay Okay . Isn't it bitter like that {gap} ? Three . Yeah yeah yeah . {vocalsound} Then {vocalsound} uh let me {disfmarker} What other {disfmarker} The other criterion is is it technologically uh technologically in innovative . Is it easy to use ? {vocalsound} Feasible ? {vocalsound} You said previously that you {disfmarker} there's um microphone inside an Ye uh {disfmarker} Embedded . Yeah , this is microphone array , in fact . It's a micro array , okay . There four microphone . Oh . Okay , So they they they they {disfmarker} there's a microphone array . and you have the {disfmarker} there's the technology inside that recognise simple vocal comments ? Yeah , yeah . And you can turn it so maybe it's techno technologically innov innovative ? So you can capture voice {disfmarker} yeah , you c Oh yeah , yeah . Yeah , so you can capture s voice from different directions . Yeah . And I think you {disfmarker} you've never seen a rou a round remote control , so it is {disfmarker} I Yeah bu but when you say technologically it's more uh I dunno , in the core , or single . {vocalsound} W Yeah , but {disfmarker} We have tactile buttons . Mm-hmm . I see , you have microphone array embedded . You have {disfmarker} No , that's good . Yeah . That's good . Oh , yeah . Yeah , th that's another really good point . Maybe {disfmarker} okay . I think technically it's acceptable , so {disfmarker} Maybe two ? Yeah . So using the same scale , two ? Two ? I would say two Two , yeah , two . It's it's fine , so . . You agree ? Yeah , I agree . Okay . It's better like that , isn't it ? {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Now maybe the most critical one . Okay . {vocalsound} Most {disfmarker} {vocalsound} L last one w I would like to judge is is it easy to use ? Eh , for th the vocal command yes , it's might be easy . But it's just speaking . Yeah , it's very easy . You just need the command . You can use this in this way . Yeah but this this turning {disfmarker} can you can you just re explain me the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} As a principle . {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} Please . Th this is the base . {vocalsound} So you can turn to change the channel . Yeah . Yeah but how how intuitive is it to turn things to change channels ? You just tu turn d d I think maybe if you he Oh , ok I understand . Like if you want to go from {disfmarker} {vocalsound} You take take {vocalsound} the remote , so {disfmarker} If you hear some click {disfmarker} and you can turn like that to change the channel ? {vocalsound} Yeah . Yeah . Yeah but imagine you y I think it's quite easy to so s zapping , but maybe it will be too fast . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah I'm I'm no I'm not definitely convinced it's it's the best way to {disfmarker} if you wanna jump from , I dunno , one to twenty ? Oh yeah , that's difficult . That's dif that's difficult . Yeah . How can you go directly to twenty , for example ? {vocalsound} No , no , no . I {disfmarker} if y uh if {disfmarker} Yeah . it depend on the the angle you turn the {disfmarker} Yeah . I agree . I agree . Yeah but y how {disfmarker} you need to know {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} But I mean if you're fro from two ? I if if this is a channel one . So it c it could be channel two , channel three , channel four , channel five . I think something that {disfmarker} Yeah . Yeah , you have a {vocalsound} , like that , and so on . So change . Yeah . And you you can {disfmarker} Yeah ju just imagine you have fifty fifty channels uh {disfmarker} Oh yeah . Y uh fifth channel divided by the num by the {disfmarker} by three hundred thirteen degree . We're not talking {disfmarker} Yeah . So you got how many degree you you {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} Yeah but y but you have to go through all the channels if you want to go {disfmarker} I think you can if you have a scale , so {disfmarker} No no , you don't have to y no it's uh when you when you stop t uh when you stop , the the turn , Mm-hmm . then the angle you stop is the angle you {disfmarker} is the channel you {disfmarker} Yeah . How d how do you know this angle is th is the correct one ? It's it's very easy , because you kn you know how many channel are there in the {disfmarker} So you you count {gap} one degree , two degrees , no . Yeah , yeah , yeah . You can do it . I don't think so . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah , it's a bit difficult . I think so {vocalsound} I think so you can do it . {vocalsound} I think so , you can just change . I think b but the the vocal command is easy too . You can say fifty and fifty it's okay , so {disfmarker} Yeah voc vocal command is okay . But w we've said previously that maybe it's not going to be th l the main {disfmarker} There's uh also a number , you know . Yeah , but when you're zapping you're changing from one channel to the other , so you're passing through all the channels . So , when you say I want to go to the channel number twenty that's {disfmarker} you've decided to go to channel twenty , so you can say channel twenty , or channel four , because you really want to go on this channel . Uh , yeah , and y that's {disfmarker} yeah . But if you really want to to do zapping you you don't really know what you want to do , you can turn it . And this would be more for browsing , ah . {vocalsound} Yeah . Just go through all the channels and maybe stop if there is something interesting ? Yeah . To see uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Mm-hmm . yeah {vocalsound} uh {disfmarker} Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Mm-hmm . Seems to be good . Yeah . {vocalsound} Good choice , mister David Jordan . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} Yeah , I mean you're famous . You {gap} . And but I'd {disfmarker} And also you can , if you i {gap} yeah , what's what's this cherry ? You ca you can turn this . Or you ca you can you can also turn this . It is a turn off t turn off button , maybe . For this you can tune it's for tune . You you if you want to skip from channel one to channel two , you you skip this . If you want to from uh skip from channel one to channel ten you tune this . {vocalsound} {gap} {vocalsound} It's like fine , from coarse to fine . Mm . This is coarse , this is fine . Yeah , yeah yeah . That's Okay . So it's coarse to fine design . that's very technologic , so . {vocalsound} Yeah . Yeah . {vocalsound} Okay the uh th this looks better . Yeah . Yeah is is {disfmarker} this is , from one channel to maybe to ten channel . S But I di I didn't see where the t f the turn off t turn on turn off button so much activates This is from one channel to {disfmarker} maybe one of the {disfmarker} Yeah . Yeah . Yeah , th you have the vocal commands . Uh it's k {gap} Yeah . On off . on off , yeah . {vocalsound} Yeah , but it has to be on to recognise fas {vocalsound} Most of the time you have the {disfmarker} yeah it's a sleeping remote control . {vocalsound} Yeah , sleeping . Ah , that's not the ecological part , yeah . That's true . W that why we have the solar ti yeah . {vocalsound} To compensate {gap} . Solar . {vocalsound} Yeah . Okay . So So , which number ? {disfmarker} three . {vocalsound} Easy to use , it's very relative but three it's fine , I think , it's reasonable three . {vocalsound} Do you agree ? Mm-hmm . Three ? Yeah , agree , agree . So reasonably , is four , is one ? Three f three for me , it's o it's okay . So , three . {gap} {vocalsound} Four or three . Maybe you can vote to see how many everybody gives and {disfmarker} no and just take the mean . {vocalsound} And what's your opinion ? Will you give four ? Uh we wouldn't say , I mean , those are sort of agreed but this one would be more five to me . Five ? Yeah , so maybe if {disfmarker} Uh w w what do y what uh {disfmarker} you compare with traditional uh um tr traditional controller ? Yeah . I think it's easier than traditional controller . If you use traditional controller you have to put a button , but now you don't have to put button , you have {disfmarker} you just turn the turn the ball . Yeah but y you know {gap} {disfmarker} There's two kind of balls , So you have {disfmarker} the smaller the the the {disfmarker} so you can c you can c you can control the scale . {vocalsound} yeah . But in the traditional controller , how do {disfmarker} how can you control the scale ? Uh by pushing zero after after the first one . You just push two button , zero and and one . Yeah , And that's {disfmarker} {vocalsound} yeah , yeah , y you you can do it , but you can also do it in the b if you you do not wa if you do not want to browsing all the channel you can just p there's also a button here . Yeah . Are there some buttons ? Okay . Yeah , this function is just for your browsing , from one channel to th the next one , the next s sn s , the th the third one . It's not what you said previously . Mm-hmm . Previously you said that turning this was the fine {disfmarker} Yeah , if you're changing your mind . {gap} Fine to coarse . Fine to coarse . Yeah , yeah . And from ten to ten channels here . Y one to ten , ten to twelve , uh ten to t uh twenty . Ten to twenty and this one , t one two three four five six , like this . Okay . Uh there's different scale , so you can you can choose how much do you want to sc Okay . But this this has to stay on the table , right ? Mm-hmm . This has to stay on the table . {vocalsound} In fact on a flat place {disfmarker} I i this is just a base . You can just {disfmarker} You can {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Yeah . Yeah but then uh when you turn turn it {disfmarker} Oh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah , no no , no . You can't put it out . Oh ye yes , that's right . Just {disfmarker} It's {disfmarker} It's just your turning from the base . You need to have everything in hand . If you want to turn , you can't use it and turn . {vocalsound} It's impossible . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Oh You need to put it on and turn . {vocalsound} Yeah . You know tha that's the weak point , {vocalsound} You use your y because with a traditional one you just have one hand . Yeah , but nobody would be able to take it in the pocket and bring it in the kitchen and say I've lost the remote control . my God . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {gap} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} So th this is a d next generation controller . {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} Nobody would take it . {vocalsound} Sure . {vocalsound} Yeah , you would never you would never lose this one , yeah . So nobody w will lost {disfmarker} lose it . {vocalsound} yeah maybe , maybe may Yeah . {vocalsound} it's the next prototype , maybe we cou {vocalsound} Okay okay , okay . S maybe we can change from th Four . Maybe four , it's okay . Four . Okay . Four ? Easy to use , four . I'll put four . Gonna say four . Four . Yeah , four it's more reasonable . Uh it's even easier to {disfmarker} maybe . You can you can erase with this er yeah . Ok Okay . Mm . Yeah , four it's more reasonable , so . So it's nine , So , average ? nine over three . Three ? Three ? Trois . Three . {vocalsound} Oh yeah , it's {gap} . Trois . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Okay , so {disfmarker} It need maybe some wo further work , but it's {disfmarker} Yeah , especially on the easy to use Yeah , uh s yeah . Yeah . target . Might {disfmarker} it might be fine . So , th the project is accepted ? Okay . Yeah . Yeah , b I think {vocalsound} {disfmarker} But I d m I think that it will be good to do some more work to transform this into a pineapple . Yeah , yeah . Yeah . If you re we really want to have a fruitful remote control . {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Okay . {vocalsound} So uh mm mm . Mm . That's the finance . {vocalsound} Okay and we we had a project prototype presentation with the evaluation . So as we all agree to accept , under certain conditions , the prototype , we'll have look to the final sh financial view . Yeah . Mm . Okay . {vocalsound} So we need to calculate the production cost . As I said in the first meeting we need to have so a remote control that would cost not more than twelve and point fifty Euros . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . And if not {disfmarker} if it's not the case y you would have to redesign it . Mm-hmm . Oh yeah . Yeah . So , just have a look at the {disfmarker} okay here is the Excel sheet , so {vocalsound} so it has the energy source . We have hand dynamo . No , we don't use that . No . We have battery , right ? Yeah , we have battery . Kinetic , we don't have it , I suppose , No , but we have solar cells . um solar cells , yeah . Um , how many do y do you need , solar cells ? Do you think one would be enough , or {disfmarker} such as {vocalsound} as number of branches ? Uh I think in each ball you have three {disfmarker} Three ? three uh yeah , three , yeah . Three {gap} three solar cells . So , electronic . Single simple chip on print ? Just one would be necessary ? S s simple , simple , yeah . One ? Yeah . Zero for the others . And sample sensor , sample speaker . One ? Mm . One maybe , yeah . As we have voice recognition , I think . Yeah yeah yeah . So the case . Is it {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Is sh it {gap} So we are all already nineteen . Wooden . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Okay , {vocalsound} just keep on going , just to have an idea . The solar cell is too expensive . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} Is {disfmarker} Yes a wooden pl I and that's {disfmarker} Well uh {disfmarker} There's no wood , so plastic just only , I think . yeah , but what what about case ? Uncurved , flat , single curved , double curved . I think it's more like double curved . That's gonna be double curved , yeah . Double curve , yeah , double curve . One ? One , you have . {vocalsound} Uh wood ? {vocalsound} But it's {disfmarker} yeah , a a rubber uh {disfmarker} Rather four buttons . Uh do we need special colour ? Oh no , interface . Y maybe , two ? We have two special colours . Yeah , yeah . Y y yeah , yeah . Yeah , yeah that's special colours , sure . Push button . Mm . Yeah , we have four . Five ? {vocalsound} Five . {vocalsound} Okay . {vocalsound} Scroll wheel . We don no . No . It it's more like integrated scor . I think that this will be like a scroll wheel , actually . No no . Yeah tha that's wheel . Y you tu you turn you turn it , so {disfmarker} No no no , it {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Okay . Yeah , maybe two scroll wheel , as we have the coarse coarse to fine scroll wheel . Yeah . Yeah , true . Yeah , yeah . Yeah . Okay , yeah , yeah . Scr So , no button supplements ? I think the price is okay . No . Okay . Um , no . Okay we {disfmarker} I think we have problem . {vocalsound} L_C_ display , maybe . Interface . I think we s if we keep on adding things {disfmarker} It's okay . {vocalsound} {gap} fine {gap} . so we have to {disfmarker} Yeah w one of the m key point is solar cells . Maybe if w t if suppose if we change and we g put just one ? Yeah . Has it changed . {vocalsound} Yeah , it was stage one , so . No y i it did change , but Okay . We have change the electronics to {disfmarker} from from the the the sample sensor to regular chip . Oh . just imagine we have {disfmarker} So {disfmarker} We have to delete the the sample sensor , I think . Yeah , but we have {disfmarker} you {disfmarker} the the voice recognition , Yeah . no ? Yeah but this one one of the feature we were not really {disfmarker} Yeah it's the one it's {disfmarker} Okay . m maybe we ha we have two versions , the first version , the basic version . I think you can transform the wood into plastic , maybe . Advanced version we have speak . Yeah . Because uh it seems that this can be {disfmarker} Yeah , if {disfmarker} Or it would be better . yeah , wood into plastic and it it should be fine . Plastic is free . {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} So , do we need special colour ? Yeah , that's one of the requirement . Because we have red . Yeah , red and yellow . Red and yellow . Wait . Fancy . We we can we can we c {vocalsound} We could turn we could turn everything in either yellow or black . yellow . Black then is a regular colour , so . I think so we need {disfmarker} if we try to have a kind of {gap} Yeah , one . pineapple bee . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah . So push button then it's it's the next expensive one . Yeah . An but we have integrated scroll wheel with push dut button . And I think this is one . Integrated scroll wheel push button Yeah , thi this might be . . So we'll {disfmarker} we have only one ? And push button . Close to . So if we have all integrated i in the scroll wheel and push button , it's uh {disfmarker} One . I can remove maybe f you have five with push buttons , so we can just , I dunno , try to modify some of them to have {disfmarker} yeah . Okay , so what's the bottleneck ? How about we change the sale ? Double curved . Double curve . We can transform the double curve into single c yeah . Something flat . F some {disfmarker} Yeah , but flat {disfmarker} S uncurved . Yeah , maybe not . {vocalsound} Single curve {gap} . Case , what's the ca Yeah . Single curve should be fine , so . Oh , what {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Mm . Nearly . Ah we have one {disfmarker} {vocalsound} And then one Euro left . {vocalsound} Um . {vocalsound} Maybe don't bat no battery , only solar cells . {vocalsound} It's it's a bad idea , so . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I think there's a problem with the push push button . We only need maybe just one . {vocalsound} Two ? Just one . One . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah . That's fine . That's fine . {vocalsound} Okay . Okay . {vocalsound} Agree . So {vocalsound} yeah , you will have {disfmarker} So we have one button , {gap} One s one scroll wheel , so one wheel . So one button , and s scroll wheel with push button on it . {vocalsound} {disfmarker} {vocalsound} And the vocal chord , it's fine . {gap} It I th it's fine . So {disfmarker} It's good they're not charging anything for that . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} So , yeah . It think we we've done good job , as the cost is Cou could we have look {disfmarker} twelve fifty e Could we have look at the p the the prod the p the cost ? Yeah y actually it's wrong . We're not under twelve Euros and a half . {vocalsound} Yeah , but it's under or equal . It's not written . Sometimes it's under or equal . It's fine . It's under or equal . It's fine , so {disfmarker} Okay . Okay . {vocalsound} Okay . So let's say {disfmarker} Twelve fifty . Wha what {disfmarker} It's fine , twelve fifty uh {disfmarker} yeah . Which part is the most expensive part ? {vocalsound} Solar cells . Yeah , I think . The solar cells , r is i is it ? Yeah , I think it's not t t I think , yeah . But it would i be interesting for our marketing team , to make a lot of advertisement concerning these solar cells to be {disfmarker} Yeah , to be able to si to sell it . Yeah . Cheaper . That's nice argument , Yeah , with mi but if it's it's still four our of twelve . It's {disfmarker} it is really really uh really very very expensive , though . Yeah . Maybe if uh {disfmarker} okay . Yeah but it will be technologically innova innovative , so . {vocalsound} Okay . Yeah , yeah . Yeah but we just have one button . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} So it's easy to use and powerful , as the remote control a has only one button . Easy . I don't know about powerful . Yeah . Easy , powerful . It's easy to use . It's very easy to use . {gap} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Mm . So I don't think we need to redesign the p the product . No . Uh that's what we've just done . We've done it with {disfmarker} it is under the {disfmarker} if it was low , high or so . Yeah . Yeah . So {disfmarker} Um okay . Now {disfmarker} So {disfmarker} So what are we going to do with this project evaluation ? So {disfmarker} Well I think we have just have to discuss if {disfmarker} Okay , okay , it's fine . I dunno . So did you enjoy your clay modelling ? Yes . Of course . This is my job . {vocalsound} Yeah ? {vocalsound} Was it a nice way to create your remote control ? {vocalsound} Yeah , it's uh it's good , to to create a control instead of a computer . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah , I think I find it really funny and amazing and interesting to go through all the process to {disfmarker} from the beginning to the end . And designing , looking at the chips , the solar cells and uh and it was very {vocalsound} informative for {gap} . Yeah . And for the marketing guy ? Uh tha that was good but we should have more brainstorming like meetings , maybe . Yep {vocalsound} . 'Cause we just presenting one is presenting his stuff Okay . next one his stuff and then we try to combine afterwards , so it {disfmarker} um . Okay , okay . And new ideas about new products , maybe , wi which would be fashion and uh and yellow . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yellow . {vocalsound} I think you can think about a yellow T_V_ now after {disfmarker} {vocalsound} a fruit T_V_ or I dunno . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} It can be an interesting I don't know {disfmarker} Yes , just lemon . Yeah , just a lemon T_V_ it'd be {vocalsound} yellow lemon . Yeah , but y you know the traditional T_V_ it's um {disfmarker} It's flat , uh {disfmarker} Yeah yeah it's flat , Squared ? yeah the shape is very boring . Yeah , that's right . It's really boring , yeah . Could we come up with new T_V_ with {disfmarker} such as this kind of T_V_ ? Yeah . {vocalsound} So you can {disfmarker} {vocalsound} you have base , triangle base so you the T_V_ you can {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Ah , the lemon T_V_ with the pineapple remote control . {vocalsound} Yeah , that's {disfmarker} that would be really interesting , actually . Yeah . Yeah . Because the T_V_ you {vocalsound} also {disfmarker} Oh , that's interesting . You could f we could do a kind of fruit collection of electronics things . Electronic device . {vocalsound} {gap} Device devi {vocalsound} Yeah . Yeah , but just don't trust too much the trends . Yeah . The fruit ? {vocalsound} Yeah . Maybe {disfmarker} 'Cause fruit and vegetables it won't last for ten years uh . Yeah , maybe la next year it will be insects . Yeah , it's {disfmarker} Maybe two years it's dead . {vocalsound} Yeah . But I think it's good to follow the f flow and you know make it now and after , you know , if the people change their mind you change also the product . Yeah . Mm . Yeah , but this is good because it's not a long long life product . Yeah . T_V_ is more like fifteen years , maybe , so . Yeah , yeah . That's a {disfmarker} yeah , yeah . If you have a lemon lemon T_V_ for We can think about T_V_ with you know where you can change you know the aspects o like for the cell phones , you know . fifteen years {disfmarker} Customable T_V_ . Yeah , you customise it every ti so every ti if people change , you just change the appearance , and y y you can keep {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Yeah , yeah . Ah such {disfmarker} yeah . You've already said mobile phones . Okay . Tha that would that would make it . Yeah . Yeah , you can keep the global appearan Yeah , and following {disfmarker} The mood of persons , the fashions uh {disfmarker} Mm . Yeah . It's interesting , maybe we can create a a line of uh T_V_ with uh a a tr We int {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah , T_V_ , yeah . A T_V_ for autumn and a T_V_ for winter , you know , so it's {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Yeah . Yeah . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} So what i and do w is it {vocalsound} {disfmarker} Okay . So I think the costs are within the budget . We're just at twelve fifty Euros . Yeah , the pr {gap} at {disfmarker} Yep . Yeah . So {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} do you think you can celebrate your creation ? And you can celebrate your leadership . {vocalsound} Oh , thanks a lot . {vocalsound} Thank you , mister David Jordan . {vocalsound} Yeah but I think f {vocalsound} it's really a celebrating object . {vocalsound} So it's yellow and very {disfmarker} a very ha it's very happy , so . {vocalsound} Yeah . Hmm . Uh it's it's a pr it's like {disfmarker} yeah . Yeah . It's party party remote control . The thing now is to to sell it . {vocalsound} Yeah , it's your job . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah , {vocalsound} Sell it . {vocalsound} right , go and sell it . Goo and good luck , so {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} Yeah . Okay and the twelve fifty {disfmarker} twelve uh twelve {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Uh-huh . Twenty five Euros . Twenty five Euros , yeah . {vocalsound} It should be fine . Yeah , I think it's {vocalsound} {disfmarker} It's maybe a little bit expensive . {vocalsound} Twenty five Euros . It's cheap , yeah . {vocalsound} No , I {disfmarker} {vocalsound} No , it's not so expensive . I'm not so happy about the fruit shape , you know . {vocalsound} Wh really ? {vocalsound} It should be it should be fine , you know , actually . {vocalsound} S {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Okay . Maybe what you can do a test . Put it outside , and if bees come , {vocalsound} it's really fruit . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} I I think I like {vocalsound} the the colour a the colour are very good , so actually so {disfmarker} {vocalsound} But don't put sugar in it , it's not working . Okay . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} No , the colours are uh {disfmarker} it's perfect , yeah . It's perfect , and {disfmarker} True . Uh yeah , another thing is the logo is missing still . I p is th y {vocalsound} Yeah , but the colour , I think the colour is more {disfmarker} is most important , the the yellow ball thing that {disfmarker} Uh {disfmarker} because I I don't think you have ever seen something like that before for a remote control . Still that was one of the requirements we had . It's {disfmarker} yeah but it {disfmarker} I don't think it's such a problem just putting the logo somewhere . Uh f like y we can we can put some uh double R_ {disfmarker} Yeah , but we decided to have something yellow and red , for the costs . Yeah . So maybe we can just integrate it on th on one side , the double R_ . Mm . Okay yeah , yeah . That's actually good idea , so {disfmarker} Yeah . Mm . So we have the logo , we have the colour , and we have the fashion in electronics , So we have to give a {disfmarker} so we have the slogan too . So we have give him {disfmarker} give it a cute name . Yeah {gap} th no , it's the it's the pineapple control {disfmarker} remote control . Mush mushroom controller . Cute na You cannot say mushroom because it's not the trend . It's a pineapple now , it has changed . It's a pineapple . It's not a mushroom . {vocalsound} It's a pineapple remote controls . It's not the trend . Pineapple . Pa Pine apple . Yeah , pineapple remote remote control . Yeah , but just flying saucer , or {disfmarker} With cherry on top . {vocalsound} Oh , that {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Okay . I would say flying saucer . Oh unid uh unidentified remote control , so {disfmarker} {vocalsound} It's more appropriate , somehow . {vocalsound} Okay . That's that's pineapple remote control . I think it's fine . Okay . {vocalsound} Will you buy one ? Yeah . Yeah I will try {vocalsound} I'll try {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Okay . Mm . {vocalsound} Try to . Okay uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Twenty five {vocalsound} Euro . {gap} . I can hel I will try versions so to see how easy easy to manage {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Okay . Yeah you told me you h you d you d you lost your control your T_V_ {vocalsound} Yeah I always lose my {disfmarker} Yeah , so so i if it is a universal one I can use it with my T_V_ , so it would be {disfmarker} {vocalsound} so you need to buy one . {vocalsound} One thing I like is the shape , because you know it's not like the uh the remote controls you can put in your pocket , on uh in your jacket . Okay . {vocalsound} Mm . {gap} Traditional one ? Yeah . So this one and this one . What do you choose ? I prefer the laser remote control . {vocalsound} No . {vocalsound} I think I would choose this one because of the colour . It's {vocalsound} {vocalsound} What do you choose ? Okay . it's will enlight your house , your home and your T_V_ , so . Okay . Oh . Maybe next if we decide to do something we'd {disfmarker} can put light inside . Yeah . Yeah , yeah that would be uh an idea . Yeah but that's going to be expensive , you know . Yeah . We had some problems {vocalsound} going to twelve Euros and uh I dunno . {vocalsound} {gap} . {vocalsound} I think it it would be interesting to {disfmarker} just to see if we can {disfmarker} if people will buy this one , and maybe add some features to it after yeah . Yeah , afterwards , if Yeah . Yeah . if it's a new trend . Okay . So {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Yeah that's that fine . So we can celebrate now . That's our new product . Champagne {gap} , mister Baba . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yes . We should celebrate . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} It's it's fine . It's {disfmarker} I like it {vocalsound} . {vocalsound} Next time . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} So buy one . {vocalsound} Well , I'll buy one here . Yeah . {vocalsound} So {disfmarker} Mm . Okay , I will close this . Mm . Yeah . No ? {vocalsound} So I think we have finished the designing and the evaluation of our remote control Okay . Okay . Yeah . and we have a nearly final product . Our final prototype which {disfmarker} yeah . Final prototype , yeah , ye yeah . Final prototype , right . Prototype , yeah . So , thank you very much . Okay . Okay . {vocalsound} Okay . Okay . Very productive . {vocalsound} Okay . Thanks . S so who is going to take the remote control ?",
        "summarize": "This was a meeting on the detailed design. First, the user interface designer presented a prototype to show the basic colour and shape of the product. Next, the marketing suggested doing some product evaluation instead of just talking about it, so the group started to judge the design in three aspects: how fancy, technologically innovative, and easy-to-use the remote control was. It got three, two, and four in separate aspects, which meant the design was acceptable. Later, the group discussed the quotation and made some decisions on details of industrial design to make sure the cost was within the budget. Furthermore, they came up with some new ideas about future products, such as a fruit collection of electronic devices or a customizable TV that followed the trend and people's moods. Finally, the group named the product as pineapple remote control."
